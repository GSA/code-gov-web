<p><a href="/#!/policy-guide/policy/open-source">Section 5 of the Federal Source Code Policy</a> outlines an Open Source Pilot Program that requires the release of a portion of Federal source code over three years. This section of code.gov provides advice for agencies in satisfying the requirements of the pilot.</p>
<p>The open source practice for the U.S. government is expected to rapidly evolve and become more sophisticated over the next several years, so the advice provided here will also evolve.</p>
<p>In addition to the requirements outline in <a href="/#!/policy-guide/policy/open-source">Section 5</a> of the policy, <a href="#roles-and-responsibilities">Section 7.1</a> of the policy discusses roles and responsibilities within agencies in meeting the requirements of the policy. Regarding the Open Source Pilot Program specifically, it notes that:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Agencies should strengthen internal capacity to efficiently and securely deliver OSS as part of regular operations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whether it is with a focus on building capacity in software acquisition, development, or both, agencies will benefit from developing staff expertise in a number of areas. In some cases, agencies may also want to build in-house technical capacity.</p>
<h2 id="engagedandsupportiveagencyleadership">Engaged and supportive agency leadership</h2>
<p>Agencies and teams that have been most successful in establishing their open source practice have benefited from engaged and supportive agency leadership who have helped teams navigate key legal, security, and operational issues. Strong engagement from the agency CIO and other leadership can have the effect of convening the necessary stakeholders to have a serious conversation. It can also greatly accelerate the establishment of clear, repeatable processes and foundational policy. With this foundation in place, your agency's teams can refine policy and process as they learn together.</p>
<h2 id="opensourceisaninterdisciplinarypractice">Open Source is an interdisciplinary practice</h2>
<p><a href="#roles-and-responsibilities">Section 7.1</a> of the policy provides a long (and non-exhaustive) list of individuals and teams who have a role in your agency's open source practice:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>[..] agency heads must ensure that CIOs and Senior Agency Officials,including CAOs, are positioned with the responsibility and authority necessary to implement the requirements of this policy. As appropriate, Senior Agency Officials should also work with the agency’s public affairs staff, open government staff, web manager or digital strategist, program owners, and other leadership to properly identify, publish, and collaborate with communities on their OSS projects.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In order to be successful in meeting the requirements of the policy and realize return on its investment in open source, your agency shouldn't treat it as merely a technical or acquisitions issue. Instead, the most successful agencies will approach open source in a similar manner to security and change management - as an essentially interdisciplinary capability that requires deliberate, formal coordination across the organization.</p>
<h2 id="consultwithpeeragenciesandsharepractices">Consult with peer agencies and share practices</h2>
<p>In the spirit of open source development, agencies can benefit greatly from adopting each other’s approaches to open source generally and even specific language that has been developed with regards to issues like licensing and contracting. Complex topics like security, communications, and even how to run a successful hackathon are ripe for collaboration between agencies to share lessons learned and pool limited resources.</p>
