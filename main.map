Agency's Open Source Practice</h1>\\n<p>\\n<a rel=\\\"noopener\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"https://sourcecode.cio.gov/OSS#open-source-software\\\">Section 5 of the Federal Source Code Policy</a> outlines an Open Source Pilot Program that requires the release of a portion of Federal source code over the next three years. This section of code.gov provides advice for agencies in satisfying the requirements of the pilot.\\n</p>\\n<p>The open source practice for the U.S. government is expected to rapidly evolve and become more sophisticated over the next several years, so the advice provided here will also evolve.</p>\\n<p>In addition to the requirements outline in <a rel=\\\"noopener\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"https://sourcecode.cio.gov/OSS#open-source-software\\\">Section 5</a> of the policy, <a rel=\\\"noopener\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"https://sourcecode.cio.gov/Implementation/#roles-and-responsibilities\\\">Section 7.1</a> of the policy discusses roles and responsibilities within agencies in meeting the requirements of the policy. Regarding the Open Source Pilot Program specifically, it notes that:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n  <p>\\n    Agencies should strengthen internal capacity to efficiently and securely deliver OSS as part of regular operations.\\n  </p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>Whether it is with a focus on building capacity in software acquisition, development, or both, agencies will benefit from developing staff expertise in a number of areas. In some cases, agencies may also want to build in-house technical capacity.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Engaged and supportive agency leadership</h2>\\n<p>Agencies and teams that have been most successful in establishing their open source practice have benefited from engaged and supportive agency leadership who have helped teams navigate key legal, security, and operational issues. Strong engagement from the agency CIO and other leadership can have the effect of convening the necessary stakeholders to have a serious conversation. It can also greatly accelerate the establishment of clear, repeatable processes and foundational policy. With this foundation in place, your agency's teams can refine policy and process as they learn together.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Open Source is an interdisciplinary practice</h2>\\n<p> <a rel=\\\"noopener\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"https://sourcecode.cio.gov/Implementation/#roles-and-responsibilities\\\">Section 7.1</a> of the policy provides a long (and non-exhaustive) list of individuals and teams who have a role in your agency's open source practice:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n  <p>\\n    [..] agency heads must ensure that CIOs and Senior Agency Officials,including CAOs, are positioned with the responsibility and authority necessary to implement the requirements of this policy. As appropriate, Senior Agency Officials should also work with the agency&rsquo;s public affairs staff, open government staff, web manager or digital strategist, program owners, and other leadership to properly identify, publish, and collaborate with communities on their OSS projects.\\n  </p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>In order to be successful in meeting the requirements of the policy and realize return on its investment in open source, your agency shouldn't treat it as merely a technical or acquisitions issue. Instead, the most successful agencies will approach open source in a similar manner to security and change management - as an essentially interdisciplinary capability that requires deliberate, formal coordination across the organization.</p>\\n<h2>Consult with peer agencies and share practices</h2>\\n<p>In the spirit of open source development, agencies can benefit greatly from adopting each other&rsquo;s approaches to open source generally and even specific language that has been developed with regards to issues like licensing and contracting. Complex topics like security, communications, and even how to run a successful hackathon are ripe for collaboration between agencies to share lessons learned and pool limited resources.</p>\\n\"\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./src/app/components/policy-guide/docs/capacity/capacity-introduction/capacity-introduction.template.html\n// module id = ./src/app/components/policy-guide/docs/capacity/capacity-introduction/capacity-introduction.template.html\n// module chunks = 1","export * from './capacity-introduction.component';\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// node_modules/angular2-template-loader!./src/app/components/policy-guide/docs/capacity/capacity-introduction/index.ts","import { Component } from '@angular/core';\nimport { SeoService } from '../../../../../services/seo';\n\n@Component({\n  selector: 'resources',\n  template: require('./capacity-resources.template.html')\n})\n\nexport class CapacityResourcesComponent {\nconstructor(private seoService: SeoService) {\n    seoService.setTitle('Tools and Resources', true);\n    seoService.setMetaDescription('A growing list of tools and resources that agencies can use to share and open source their code.');\n    seoService.setMetaRobots('Index, Follow');\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// node_modules/angular2-template-loader!./src/app/components/policy-guide/docs/capacity/capacity-resources/capacity-resources.component.ts","module.exports = \"<h1>Tools and Resources</h1>\\n<p><a rel=\\\"noopener\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"https://sourcecode.cio.gov/Implementation/#code-repositories\\\">Section 7.4</a>&nbsp;of the Federal Source Code Policy states:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n  <p>\\n    Accessible, buildable, version-controlled repositories for the storage, discussion, and modification of custom-developed code are critical to both the Government-wide reuse and OSS pilot program sections of this policy.

Some questions to ask when selecting such a system are:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Does the system provide the ability to develop in the open?</li>\\n<li>Does your agency need both private and public repositories, and does the system allow seamless integration between the two?</li>\\n<li>Is the system interoperable with open source version control standards, such as <a external-link href=\\\"https://git-scm.com/\\\">git</a> or <a external-link href=\\\"https://www.mercurial-scm.org/\\\">mercurial</a>? Interoperability with an open standard is crucial to your agency's ability to collaborate with other agencies and the open source community and will greatly ease future platform integrations and migrations.</li>\\n<li>To engage the open source community your agency may want to consider the social features of the system beyond version control. Does it provide features that will help your agency to promote and share its code? How vibrant is the existing user community?</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Agencies may want to take a look at the following version control systems based on their functionality and significant adoption by the open source community:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a external-link href=\\\"https://github.com/\\\">Github</a></li>\\n<li><a external-link href=\\\"https://gitlab.com/\\\">Gitlab</a></li>\\n<li><a external-link href=\\\"https://bitbucket.org/\\\">Bitbucket</a></li>\\n</ul>\\n<h2>Code quality and security</h2>\\n<p>A number of paid and free tools exist that agencies can use as part of their development process that, if used appropriately, should lower the risk that inappropriate or insecure content is released.&nbsp; Because these tools can help automate some processes that would otherwise be manual, they can simultaneously help lower costs overall.</p>\\n<p>Increasingly, these tools can be configured to reflect the specific security policies of your agency and can be integrated directly into your agency's developer workflow, scanning code automatically whenever code is committed or pushed for passwords, keys, watchwords, and other potentially sensitive information. Some tools also provide broader capabilities related to coding standards and quality. In developing its overall source code strategy, your agency may want to consider integrating these kinds of tools into your developer workflow, contractually require their use by vendors, or use them to assess the quality and security of deliverables prior to accepting receipt.</p>\\n<p>We are soliciting input from the development community in building out a list of tools. Agencies should feel free to join the conversation, make suggestions, and ask questions on the <a href=\\\"https://github.com/presidential-innovation-fellows/code-gov-web/issues/101\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">open Issue on the code.gov repository</a>.</p>\\n<h2>Development practices for government</h2>\\n<p>A number of communities of practice exist that agency staff can use to keep abreast of open source inside and outside of government, to raise questions, and to share their experiences.&nbsp;</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Open Source Listserv (GSA, open to government only)</li>\\n<li>Security Listserv (GSA, open to government only)</li>\\n<li>Digital Service Listserv (GSA, open to government only)</li>\\n<li><a external-link href=\\\"https://github.com/government/welcome#readme\\\">Github for Government Community</a> (Not an official Government service)</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>As a quick reminder, agency staff must comply with applicable law and regulations and should obtain the appropriate agency approvals prior to using any of the tools ans services discussed here.</p>\\n\"\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./src/app/components/policy-guide/docs/capacity/capacity-resources/capacity-resources.template.html\n// module id = ./src/app/components/policy-guide/docs/capacity/capacity-resources/capacity-resources.template.html\n// module chunks = 1","export * from './capacity-resources.component';\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// node_modules/angular2-template-loader!./src/app/components/policy-guide/docs/capacity/capacity-resources/index.ts","import { Component } from '@angular/core';\n\n@Component({\n  selector: 'security',\n  template: require('./capacity-security.template.html')\n})\n\nexport class CapacitySecurityComponent {}\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// node_modules/angular2-template-loader!./src/app/components/policy-guide/docs/capacity/capacity-security/capacity-security.component.ts","module.exports = \"<h1>Building Security into your Open Source Practice</h1>\\n<p>One of the most common concerns raised by agencies related to opening code or developing in the open is information security.  There are a number of specific things that any open source project (governmental or otherwise) can do to protect the security of its sensitive information and its production systems. There are also quite a few myths and misconceptions about security in relation to open source that are worth debunking.</p>\\n<h2>Opening an existing codebase</h2>\\n<p>The first thing to understand when considering open sourcing code is that some types of code and data are categorically inappropriate to be made public.  Secure open source practices protect these kinds of content from publication.</p>\\n<p>While there are always exceptions and the list isn’t exhaustive, agencies should carefully consider how to limit the risk that the following types of information could be make public as part of an open source offering:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>passwords</li>\\n<li>private keys</li>\\n<li>server configurations, network topology, and similar information</li>\\n<li>national security and other sensitive information</li>\\n<li>PII</li>\\n<li>content such as inappropriate or offensive language, that could create reputational harm</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>^ someone smarter than me has created a list like this.

These practices provide an environment in which OSS can flourish and be repurposed.

Adding a version number to the schema makes it easier to track and manage changes between versions of the metadata schema.</li>\\n\\n\\t<li>‘organization’: The ‘organization’ field, which holds the name of the sub-agency responsible for a particular repository or project, is now optional. It has also been moved into the ‘projects’ object. This enables agencies to identify the appropriate organization that owns the repository within the agency.</li>\\n\\n\\t<li>‘projects’: This guide previously referred to a ‘project’ field in the metadata schema, while the sample code.json referred to the plural form ‘projects’. This guide has been updated to refer to the plural form ‘projects’.</li>\\n\\n\\t<li>‘repository’: The link to the open source repository will be considered a required field for all open source repositories. For repositories that are only available as government-wide reuse or are closed, pursuant to one of the exemptions, this field is not required.</li>\\n\\n\\t<li>‘exemptionText’: This field allows agencies to provide a brief narrative explanation for the exception requested in the 'exemption' field.</li>\\n</ul>\\n\"\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./src/app/components/policy-guide/docs/compliance/compliance-inventory-code/compliance-inventory-code.template.html\n// module id = ./src/app/components/policy-guide/docs/compliance/compliance-inventory-code/compliance-inventory-code.template.html\n// module chunks = 1","export * from './compliance-inventory-code.component';\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// node_modules/angular2-template-loader!./src/app/components/policy-guide/docs/compliance/compliance-inventory-code/index.ts","import { Component } from '@angular/core';\n\n@Component({\n  selector: 'licensing',\n  template: require('./compliance-licensing.template.html')\n})\n\nexport class ComplianceLicensingComponent {\n}\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// node_modules/angular2-template-loader!./src/app/components/policy-guide/docs/compliance/compliance-licensing/compliance-licensing.component.ts","module.exports = \"<h1>Licensing</h1>\\n<p>\\n  Content goes here.\\n</p>\\n\"\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./src/app/components/policy-guide/docs/compliance/compliance-licensing/compliance-licensing.template.html\n// module id = ./src/app/components/policy-guide/docs/compliance/compliance-licensing/compliance-licensing.template.html\n// module chunks = 1","export * from './compliance-licensing.component';\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// node_modules/angular2-template-loader!./src/app/components/policy-guide/docs/compliance/compliance-licensing/index.ts","import { Component } from '@angular/core';\nimport { SeoService } from '../../../../../services/seo';\n\n@Component({\n  selector: 'measuring-code',\n  template: require('./compliance-measuring-code.template.html')\n})\n\nexport class ComplianceMeasuringCodeComponent {\n  constructor(private seoService: SeoService) {\n    seoService.setTitle('Measuring Source Code', true);\n    seoService.setMetaDescription('Learn about different ways to measure source code and how to choose the best method for your agency.');\n    seoService.setMetaRobots('Index, Follow');\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// node_modules/angular2-template-loader!./src/app/components/policy-guide/docs/compliance/compliance-measuring-code/compliance-measuring-code.component.ts","module.exports = \"<h1>Measuring Source Code</h1>\\n<p>As part of the Open Source Pilot Program the Federal Source Code Policy requires that:</p>\\n<blockquote class=\\\"usa-quote\\\">\\n\\t<p>Each agency shall release as OSS at least 20 percent of its new custom-developed code each year.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>Broadly, to satisfy this requirement agencies will need to do two things:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Choose a method of measuring the size of code</li>\\n<li>Apply the measurement method to the total enterprise code inventory to establish a baseline</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h2>Choosing a measure</h2>\\n<p>Having established an inventory of new custom-developed code, agencies will still need to determine their method of measuring the amount of code it represents. The Open Source community and Federal developers have suggested a number of options that agencies may choose from. These include:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Source lines of code</li>\\n<li>Number of self-contained modules</li>\\n<li>Cost</li>\\n<li>Number of software projects</li>\\n<li>System certification and accreditation boundaries</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>This list is not exhaustive and agencies should choose the most appropriate measure for their organization. When choosing a measure, agencies should consider the following factors:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Automation. Is it possible to collect the data for the measure automatically or automate aspects of the collection process? For example, can a script be developed to tabulate the number of lines of source code in your repositories?</li>\\n<li>Existing processes. Does your agency already collect data or collect systems information that can be repurposed to meet this requirement?</li>\\n<li>Approximation. Given the difficulty in definitively calculating most reasonable measures related to this requirement, the Federal Source Code Policy leaves room for agencies to use approximate or \\\"estimated\\\" measures. For example, the number of source lines of code in a particular codebase may fluctuate day to day. Or if cost is your measure, the development of a particular codebase may have been purchased in combination with other services. Agencies may use approximation in measuring their code but should do so according to a documented, justifiable process that is applied consistently and considers the overall goals of the policy.</li>\\n<li>To the extent practicable, agencies should use a consistent measure across their organization.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h2>Measuring your code for the first time</h2>\\n<p>Having chosen a measure, your agency will need to measure the size of its codebases that are under active development to establish a baseline.</p>\\n<p>Things to consider include:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>This requirement complements the requirement to account for 100% of new custom-developed code in your agency&rsquo;s enterprise code inventory (or in the form of exemptions from inclusion in the inventory). Importantly, for the purposes of calculating your total amount of custom code, agencies <em>should include </em>code that is unlikely or certain not to be released for reasons of national security or the other exemptions related to the enterprise code inventory.</li>\\n<li>Remember that the Federal Source Code Policy requires each agency to release \\\"20% of its new custom-developed code each year for the term of the pilot program\\\" and does not apply retroactively. However, making such code available for Government-wide reuse or as OSS, to the extent practicable, is strongly encouraged.</li>\\n<li>In defining \\\"custom code\\\", the Federal Source Code Policy allows agencies to exclude \\\"code that is truly exploratory or disposable in nature, such as that written by a developer experimenting with a new language or library.\\\" As with measuring the size of code, agencies should adopt a consistent, justifiable approach to determining whether code qualifies and can be excluded from the enterprise code inventory and open source pilot.

From helping students and families make more informed decisions about college selection to modernizing our country’s immigration system to opening up thousands of data sets and collections for Americans to leverage, this work has reimagined how government services and resources should be provided to the public.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  The <a href=\\\"https://sourcecode.cio.gov\\\">Federal Source Code Policy</a> is designed to support reuse and public access to custom-developed Federal source code. It requires new custom-developed source code developed specifically by or for the Federal Government to be made available for sharing and re-use across all Federal agencies. It also includes an Open Source Pilot Program that requires agencies to release at least 20% of new custom-developed Federal source code to the public.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  By making source code available for sharing and re-use across Federal agencies, we can avoid duplicative custom software purchases and promote innovation and collaboration across Federal agencies. By opening more of our code to the brightest minds inside and outside of government, we can enable them to work together to ensure that the code is reliable and effective in furthering our national objectives. And we can do all of this while remaining consistent with the Federal Government’s long-standing policy of technology neutrality, through which we seek to ensure that Federal investments in IT are merit-based, improve the performance of our government, and create value for the American people.\\n</p>\\n<h2>How we'll get there</h2>\\n\\n<p>\\n This section of code.gov is designed to help agencies understand what is required by the policy and provide advice on how best to get there. Whether you're a developer, a Chief Information Officer, or an acquisition officer, this guide is for you.  Use it to better understand exactly what is required and how to maximize the benefits your agency will realize from implementation of the policy.</p>\\n\\n<p>Most importantly, unlike the policy itself, the content here is going to evolve and expand quickly.

We do not collect any information that directly identifies you when you visit Code.gov unless you choose to provide that information by contacting us. However, the website may collect a limited amount of information about your visit for the purposes of website analytics and customization. Please read this notice to understand what we do with the limited amount of information about your visit that we may collect.\\n    </p>\\n    <h3>Information Collected and Stored Automatically</h3>\\n    <p>\\n      We collect limited information about visits to Code.gov. This information is used to measure the number of visitors to the various sections of our website and to identify performance or problem areas. We also use this information to help us develop the site, analyze patterns of usage, and to make the site more useful. We do not share or sell visitor data for the purposes of advertising, marketing, or any other commercial purpose. This information is not used for associating search terms or patterns of site navigation with individual users. The information that is automatically collected and stored concerning your visit includes:\\n    </p>\\n    <ul>\\n      <li>\\n        The domain from which you access the Internet (i.e., HHS.gov if you are connecting from a HHS account, or GMU.edu if you are connecting from George Mason University’s domain);\\n      </li>\\n      <li>The date and time of your visit;</li>\\n      <li>Your location, as approximated by GPS, and other sensors;</li>\\n      <li>The type of device you used to access Code.gov (i.e., mobile or desktop);</li>\\n      <li>The operating system of the device you used to access Code.gov;</li>\\n      <li>The pages you visit on Code.gov;</li>\\n      <li>\\n        The Internet address of the website you came from if it linked you directly to Code.gov; and\\n      </li>\\n      <li>\\n        Aany search terms that you may enter when searching Code.gov.\\n      </li>\\n    </ul>\\n    <h3>How Code.gov uses Cookies</h3>\\n    <p>\\n      When you visit a website, its server may generate a piece of text known as a “cookie” to place on your device. The cookie, which is unique to your browser, allows the server to “remember” specific information about your visit while you are connected.</p>\\n    <p>There are two types of cookies – single session (temporary) and multi-session (persistent). Single session cookies last only as long as your Web browser is open. Once you close your browser, the session cookie disappears. Persistent cookies are stored on your device for longer periods. Both types of cookies create an identifier that is unique to your device. The Office of Management and Budget Memorandum M-10-22, Guidance for Online Use of Web Measurement and Customization Technologies, allows Federal entities to use both session and persistent cookies to improve the delivery of services.</p>\\n    <ul>\\n    <li>Session Cookies: We may use session cookies for technical purposes, such as to allow better navigation through our site. These cookies let our server know that you are continuing a visit to our site. Our use of session cookies qualifies as “Usage Tier 1–Single Session,” as defined in the OMB M-10-22 guidance.</li>\\n    <li>Persistent Cookies: We may use persistent cookies to understand the differences between new and returning visitors to Code.gov. Persistent cookies remain on your device between visits to our site until they expire or are removed by the user. Our use of persistent cookies qualifies as “Usage Tier 2–Multi-session without personally identifiable information,” as defined in the OMB M-10-22 guidance. The policy states, “This tier encompasses any use of multi-session Web measurement and customization technologies when no [personally identifiable information] is collected.” We do not use persistent cookies to collect personally identifiable information.</li>\\n    </ul>\\n    <p>If you do not want to accept cookies, you can edit your browser’s options to stop accepting persistent cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. Here are instructions for how you can disable cookies and/or Google Demographic and Interests reports.</p>\\n    <h3>Google Analytics</h3>\\n    <p>Code.gov participates in the U.S. Digital Analytics Program, (DAP) which utilizes a unified Google Analytics account for Federal agencies. This program helps Federal agencies understand how people find, access, and use government services online.</p>\\n    <p>The DAP is a hosted shared service provided by the General Services Administration’s (GSA’s) Office of Citizen Services and Innovative Technologies, and the protocol and information collected are the same for all websites participating in the DAP. As a participant in GSA’s DAP program, this website’s Google Analytics traffic data is automatically reported to GSA.</p>\\n    <p>Google Analytics is a third-party web measurement and customization technology as defined in OMB M-10-22 (PDF).</p>\\n    <p>Here is how it works: Google Analytics sets one or more cookies on your computer so that it can recognize your computer if you visit the Code.gov website in the future. These cookies doe not collect personally identifiable information. This is considered a Tier 2 usage, as defined in the OMB guidance.</p>\\n    <p>Google Analytics does not collect personally identifiable information through its cookies. The program does not track individuals and anonymizes the IP addresses of visitors. Common Questions about DAP (FAQ) provides more information about how IP addresses are anonymized. According to GSA’s Common Questions About DAP, “none of the federal government data tracked as part of the Data Analytics Program will be shared with or available to Google’s corporate advertising partners.”</p>\\n    <p>A limited number of authorized individuals will have user accounts that will allow them to log in to the Google Analytics dashboard and view or run reports regarding visits to Code.gov and the other web metrics available from the DAP.</p>\\n    <p>Visitors who choose to disable this web measurement tool will still have full access to Code.gov. While the details vary from browser to browser, most modern browsers can be set up to accept, reject, or request user intervention when a site asks to set a cookie.</p>\\n    <p>You can view web metrics information at <a href=\\\"https://analytics.usa.gov\\\">https://analytics.usa.gov/</a>.</p>\\n    <h3>Contacting the Office of the Federal Chief Information Officer about Code.gov</h3>\\n    <p>Users of this website may send the Office of the Federal Chief Information Officer feedback or report an issue by sending an email to code@gsa.gov. If you choose to send us your personally identifiable information, we will only use that information to respond to your message. We only share the information you give us with another government agency if your question relates to that agency, or as otherwise required by law. Code.gov never collects information or creates individual profiles for the purposes of advertising, marketing, or any other commercial purpose. When you contact us, any personally identifiable information you provide is voluntary. Please do not include sensitive personally identifiable information or other sensitive information in the content of your email.</p>\\n    <h3>Children and Privacy on Code.gov</h3>\\n    <p>We believe in the importance of protecting the privacy of children online. The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) governs information gathered online from or about children under the age of 13. This site is not intended to solicit or collection information of any kind from children under age 13. If you believe that we have received information from a child under age 13, please contact us at code@gsa.gov.</p>\\n    <h3>Security</h3>\\n    <p>This website was built using GitHub Pages, a service provided by GitHub, Inc. (GitHub) designed to enable the rapid deployment of government websites in a secure and readily accessible environment.</p>\\n    <p>The terms of service applicable to Federal users of GitHub states that it “will, in good faith, exercise due diligence using generally accepted commercial business practices for IT security, to ensure that systems are operated and maintained in a secure manner, and that management, operational and technical controls will be employed to ensure security of systems and data. Recognizing the changing nature of the Web, [GitHub] will continuously work with users to ensure that its products and services are operated and maintained in a secure manner. [GitHub] agrees to discuss implementing additional security controls as deemed necessary by the Agency to conform to the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA), 44 U.S.C. 3541 et seq.”</p>\\n    <p>We encourage you to visit <a external-link href=\\\"https://help.github.com/articles/github-terms-of-service/\\\">GitHub</a> if you have additional questions about the service.</p>\\n    <h3>Questions about the Privacy Policy</h3>\\n    <p>Write to the Code.gov team at: <a href=\\\"mailto:code@gsa.gov\\\">code@gsa.gov</a></p>\\n
