      "description": "Issue Description:\nThis task supports the Code.gov team. We want to estimate total lines of code and total hours and costs for the code that is located in all of our open source repositories. The open source repositories are listed in the agency json files as shown on Code.gov.\n\nSpecific tasks:\n\nCount total lines of code for all open source repos on Code.gov using CLOC - https://github.com/AlDanial/cloc.\nDetermine labor hours and costs of total lines of code using the COCOMO II Model - http://csse.usc.edu/tools/cocomoii.php. Parameters TBD and can work with me (Joe Castle) on this.\nProvide all of this in a program/script that can be run on a regular basis to account for new code as it is added to Code.gov\nContact Info:\nName: Joseph Castle\nEmail: joseph.castle@gsa.gov",

      "description": "Because the input for radio buttons are position: absolute, they do not scroll with the labels that follow them when inside an element that has overflow: scroll set. The end result is that once you've scrolled down within such an element, clicking on the visible labels triggers a click on the incorrect invisible input, which hasn't scrolled due to being position: absolute.\n\n(I recognize that overflow scroll is generally not preferred, but in a web application context we have a constraint that may require its use.)\n\nI believe a simple fix would be to add position: relative to one of the suggested ancestors of radio inputs. From the sample code in the docs, it looks like that might be .usa-fieldset-inputs, though I'm not sure if that would have any unintended side effects.",
