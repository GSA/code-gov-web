The Sirepo server is built on the following Python technologies: Flask, which is a lightweight framework for web development; Jinja, which is a secure and widely used templating language; and Werkzeug, a utility library that is compliant with the WSGI standard. We use Nginx as the HTTP server and proxy, which provides a scalable event-driven architecture. The physics codes supported by Sirepo execute inside a Docker container. One of the codes supported by Sirepo is the Synchrotron Radiation Workshop (SRW).

Development of this infrastructure originated at the University of Illinois DOE ASCI Center for Simulation of Advanced Rockets (CSAR) to support the center's massively parallel multiphysics simulation application, Rocstar, and has continued at IllinoisRocstar, a small company formed near the end of the University-based program. IllinoisRocstar is now licensing these new developments as free, open source, in hopes to help improve their own and others' access to infrastructure which can be readily utilized in developing coupled or composite software systems; with particular attention to more rapid production and utilization of multiphysics applications in the HPC environment. There are two major pieces to the consortium implementation, the Application Component Toolkit (ACT), and the Multiphysics Application Coupling Toolkit (MPACT). The current development focus is the ACT, which is (will be) the substrate for MPACT. The ACT itself is built up from the components described in the technical approach. In particular, the ACT has the following major components: 1.The Component Object Manager (COM): The COM package provides encapsulation of user applications, and their data. COM also provides the inter-component function call mechanism. 2.The System Integration Manager (SIM): The SIM package provides constructs and mechanisms for orchestrating composite systems of multiply integrated pieces.","laborHours":0,"name":"Multiphysics Application Coupling Toolkit","organization":"CONTR","permissions":{"exemptionText":null,"licenses":[{"URL":"https://api.github.com/licenses/bsd-3-clause","name":"BSD-3-Clause"}],"usageType":"openSource"},"repositoryURL":"https://github.com/IllinoisRocstar/IMPACT","status":"Production","tags":["doecode"],"vcs":"git","id":"DOE/Multiphysics%20Application%20Coupling%20Toolkit","agency":"DOE"},"DOE/National%20Geothermal%20Database":{"contact":{"email":"vowelll@osti.gov"},"date":{"created":"2017-10-25","metadataLastUpdated":"2017-10-25"},"description":"THE NGDS IS A USER-FRIENDLY, WEB-BASED APPLICATION TO SUPPORT FINDING, VISUALIZING, MAPPING, AND ACQUISITION OF DATA BY END-USERS.

Among the biggest soft costs are those associated with inefficiencies in local permitting and inspection. A study by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory estimates that these costs add an average of $0.22/W per residential installation. This project helps reduce non-hardware/balance of system (BOS) costs by creating and maintaining a free and available site of permitting requirements and solar system verification software that installers can use to reduce time, capital, and resource investments in tracking permitting requirements. Software tools to identify best permitting practices can enable government stakeholders to optimize their permitting process and remove superfluous costs and requirements.

BEMOSS offers the following key features: (1) Open source, open architecture – BEMOSS is an open source operating system that is built upon VOLTTRON – a distributed agent platform developed by Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL). BEMOSS was designed to make it easy for hardware manufacturers to seamlessly interface their devices with BEMOSS. Software developers can also contribute to adding additional BEMOSS functionalities and applications. (2) Plug & play – BEMOSS was designed to automatically discover supported load controllers (including smart thermostats, VAV/RTUs, lighting load controllers and plug load controllers) in commercial buildings. (3) Interoperability – BEMOSS was designed to work with load control devices form different manufacturers that operate on different communication technologies and data exchange protocols. (4) Cost effectiveness – Implementation of BEMOSS deemed to be cost-effective as it was built upon a robust open source platform that can operate on a low-cost single-board computer, such as Odroid. This feature could contribute to its rapid deployment in small- or medium-sized commercial buildings. (5) Scalability and ease of deployment – With its multi-node architecture, BEMOSS provides a distributed architecture where load controllers in a multi-floor and high occupancy building could be monitored and controlled by multiple single-board computers hosting BEMOSS. This makes it possible for a building engineer to deploy BEMOSS in one zone of a building, be comfortable with its operation, and later on expand the deployment to the entire building to make it more energy efficient. (6) Ability to provide local and remote monitoring – BEMOSS provides both local and remote monitoring ability with role-based access control. (7) Security – In addition to built-in security features provided by VOLTTRON, BEMOSS provides enhanced security features, including BEMOSS discovery approval process, encrypted core-to-node communication, thermostat anti-tampering feature and many more. (8) Support from the Advisory Committee – BEMOSS was developed in consultation with an advisory committee from the beginning of the project. BEMOSS advisory committee comprises representatives from 22 organizations from government and industry.","laborHours":0,"name":"Building Energy Management Open Source Software","organization":"CONTR","permissions":{"exemptionText":null,"licenses":[{"URL":"https://api.github.com/licenses/bsd-3-clause","name":"BSD-3-Clause"}],"usageType":"openSource"},"repositoryURL":"https://github.com/bemoss/BEMOSS3.5","status":"Production","tags":["doecode"],"vcs":"git","id":"DOE/Building%20Energy%20Management%20Open%20Source%20Software","agency":"DOE"},"DOE/COOPR%3A%20A%20COmmon%20Optimization%20Python%20Repository%20v.%201.0":{"contact":{"email":"jcrouch@sandia.gov"},"date":{"created":"2017-10-25","metadataLastUpdated":"2017-10-25"},"description":"Coopr integrates Python packages for defining optimizers, modeling optimization applications, and managing computational experiments.

It is very much a current work in progress, and much of the intended functionality is still under development. The main goal of brulilo is an easy-to-use code for quick calculations or post-processing, as well as a learning tool to test various implementations of solvers on both CPUs and GPUs. Currently, brulilo parses an input text file that specifies the reactions to be included in the network. The notation of the inputs are in the typical astrophysical notation; i.e. hydrogen burning to deuterium in the sun, \"p + p + e --> d + neutrino\", is given as \"p(p,)d.\" Each reaction is added to a list comprising the reaction network, and once completed, the network contains a list of all isotopes and reactions involved. brulilo then parses publicly available nuclear data (binding energy, spin, partition function data, etc.) for each isotope from the WebNucleo group's data at nucleo.ces.clemson.edu. Fits to reaction rate data for each reaction are obtained from the publicly available data provided by the Joint Institute for Nuclear Astrophysics' Reaclib database. Reverse reactions are calculated from detailed balance. The reaction network then consists of a sparse system of mathematically stiff ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Physically, \"stiffness\" here means that there are some reaction rates that are occurring much faster than others; the ratio of the fast to slow often being greater than 10^15 in astrophysics. Numerical integration of such systems typically involves implicit integration schemes, which brulilo will leverage from the scientific computing Python package, Numpy, as well as implement its own. There has recently been work from researchers at Oak Ridge National Lab who have found good results from applying quasi-equilibrium and quasi-asymptotic conditions to the stiff system of ODEs, which effectively remove some of the stiffness and allow for efficient explicit integration techniques to be used. The original intent of brulilo was to implement these stiffness-alleviating techniques with explicit integrators and compare the performance to traditional implicit integrations of the full stiff system.

The model is based on a specific formulation of the Population Balance Equation, derived for soluble particles. ISD3 solves for the size and spatial distribution of particle numbers, represented together as a particle number density (that is a function of particle location and diameter). From the number density, all other quantities, such as mass, concentration, size distribution and surface areas are derived. The model can be applied for any initial particle size distribution data by representing the data in terms of the number density. As a result, time dependent solutions can be obtained for all size ranges in a single run of the ISD3 simulation for a given particle type and\nmedia conditions. In the current implementation, particles are treated as spherical in shape and can be modeled as primary particles, agglomerates, or as primary particles coated with proteins. Ions are modeled as a lumped system with a uniform concentration in the liquid media. Particle transport is assumed to occur down the liquid column via diffusion and sedimentation (no fluid convection), and no aggregation/agglomeration, coagulation and break-up of the particles occur during transport. Cellular uptake kinetics of ions and particle dissolution kinetics are currently implemented using empirical models that were developed and calibrated for silver nanoparticles and ions. The ISD3 code is modular, allowing use of the existing equations for the dissolution model and ion uptake, but can be modified to include alternate models developed by the user. Application of ISD3 to another particle system would involve inputting parameters appropriate for the particles and model system. For particle uptake by cells, users have the option to use a no-flux or a perfectly absorbing ‘sticky’ boundary condition. For reactive boundary conditions, the user needs to modify a few lines of the code to express the desired form of the boundary condition (e.g., Robin type of boundary condition).","homepageURL":"http://nanodose.pnnl.gov/ModelDownload.aspx","laborHours":0,"name":"ISDDD","organization":"PNNL","permissions":{"exemptionText":null,"licenses":[{"URL":"https://api.github.com/licenses/bsd-2-clause","name":"BSD-2-Clause"}],"usageType":"openSource"},"repositoryURL":"http://nanodose.pnnl.gov/ModelDownload.aspx","status":"Development","tags":["doecode","Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL)"],"id":"DOE/ISDDD","agency":"DOE"},"DOE/fast-matmul":{"contact":{"email":"jcrouch@sandia.gov"},"date":{"created":"2017-10-25","metadataLastUpdated":"2017-10-25"},"description":"This software provides implementations of fast matrix multiplication algorithms.

Modern supercomputers are commonly being built with GPU coprocessor cards in their nodes to increase their computational efficiency and performance.

It can also be used to study self-assembling systems such as lamellae forming diblock copolymers or lipid bilayers. The types of fluids currently treated by the code include atomistic fluids (hard spheres, Lennard-Jones, ions, etc), freely-jointed polymers, and small molecules with bond constraints. The system of equations solved by this code are integral equations of finite range. They lead to sparse matrices for large physical systems, but rather dense matrices when the physical systems are small. The systems of equations are solved using a real space matrix based Newton's method.

It then serves as both a guide to show what types of security questions should be addressed and as a means to analyze the data gathered from the questions to make an informed decision. The quantitative option provides a straightforward way to express costs/benefits in terms of dollars. It relies on the organization to quantify benefits or cost avoidances, and, therefore, best serves as a guide to ensure various cost and benefit angles are evaluated. The qualitative option allows the organization to assess costs by levels with respect to security and PCS budgets, operational impacts, and opportunity costs. Benefits are represented in terms of improvements to the organization's operations and are also assessed by levels with respect to some benchmark such as compliance with best practices. Results are displayed graphically using radar charts, allowing the user to make a more intuitive decision.

It is modular, object-oriented code in which the portions of the code that are specific to one simulation are easily separable from those portions that are the constant between implementations.

The two primary applications for the RSTT library are tomographic inversion studies and seismic event location calculations. In tomographic inversions studies, a seismologist begins with number of source-receiver travel time observations and an initial starting model of the velocity distribution within the Earth. A forward travel time calculator, such as the RSTT library, is used to compute predictions of each observed travel time and all of the residuals (observed minus predicted travel time) are calculated. The Earth model is then modified in some systematic way with the goal of minimizing the residuals. The Earth model obtained in this way is assumed to be a better model than the starting model if it has lower residuals. The other major application for the RSTT library is seismic event location. Given an Earth model, an initial estimate of the location of a seismic event, and some number of observations of seismic travel time thought to have originated from that event, location codes systematically modify the estimate of the location of the event with the goal of minimizing the difference between the observed and predicted travel times. The second application, seismic event location, is routinely implemented by the military as part of its effort to monitor the Earth for nuclear tests conducted by foreign countries.","homepageURL":"http://www.sandia.gov/rstt/RSTT%20Download.html","laborHours":0,"name":"Code for Calculating Regional Seismic Travel Time","organization":"SNL","permissions":{"exemptionText":null,"licenses":[{"URL":"https://api.github.com/licenses/bsd-3-clause","name":"BSD-3-Clause"}],"usageType":"openSource"},"repositoryURL":"http://www.sandia.gov/rstt/RSTT%20Download.html","status":"Production","tags":["doecode","Sandia National Laboratories (SNL)"],"id":"DOE/Code%20for%20Calculating%20Regional%20Seismic%20Travel%20Time","agency":"DOE"},"DOE/TOOLKIT%20FOR%20ADVANCED%20OPTIMIZATION":{"contact":{"email":"dkrakowski@anl.gov"},"date":{"created":"2017-10-25","metadataLastUpdated":"2017-10-25"},"description":"The TAO project focuses on the development of software for large scale optimization problems.

The PECOS core also offers statistical utilities and transformations between various representations of stochastic uncertainty. PECOS provides a C++ API through which users can generate and transform realizations of stochastic quantities. It is currently used by Sandia's DAKOTA, Stokhos, and Encore software packages for uncertainty quantification and verification. PECOS generates random sample sets and multi-dimensional integration grids, typically used in forward propagation of scalar uncertainty in computational models (uncertainty quantification (UQ)). PECOS also generates samples of random fields (RFs) and stochastic processes (SPs) from a set of user-defined power spectral densities (PSDs). The RF/SP may be either Gaussian or non-Gaussian and either stationary or nonstationary, and the resulting sample is intended for run-time query by parallel finite element simulation codes. Finally, PECOS supports nonlinear transformations of random variables via the Nataf transformation and extensions.","laborHours":0,"name":"Parallel Environment for the Creation of Stochastics 1.0","organization":"SNL","permissions":{"exemptionText":null,"licenses":[{"URL":"https://api.github.com/licenses/gpl-3.0","name":"GPL-3.0"}],"usageType":"openSource"},"repositoryURL":"https://github.com/pemryan/DAKOTA","status":"Production","tags":["doecode","Sandia National Laboratories (SNL)"],"vcs":"git","id":"DOE/Parallel%20Environment%20for%20the%20Creation%20of%20Stochastics%201.0","agency":"DOE"},"DOE/HiPerSBTK":{"contact":{"email":"suzanne.hoffman@nrel.gov"},"date":{"created":"2017-10-25","metadataLastUpdated":"2017-10-25"},"description":"HiPerSBTK consists of software which integrates equation solving, optimization and graphical interface functions to perform large-scale systems biology modeling.","laborHours":0,"name":"HiPerSBTK","organization":"NREL","permissions":{"exemptionText":null,"licenses":[{"URL":"http://www.vtk.org/licensing/","name":"Other"}],"usageType":"openSource"},"repositoryURL":"https://gitlab.kitware.com/vtk/vtk/","status":"Production","tags":["doecode","National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)"],"id":"DOE/HiPerSBTK","agency":"DOE"},"DOE/THYME%3A%20Toolkit%20for%20Hybrid%20Modeling%20of%20Electric%20Power%20Systems":{"contact":{"email":"laymancelk@ornl.gov"},"date":{"created":"2017-10-25","metadataLastUpdated":"2017-10-25"},"description":"THYME is an object oriented library for building models of wide area control and communications in electric power systems.

We believe that the computational science community should develop integrated tools for coupling, working with and analyzing data from simulation codes instead of leaving domains scientists and students to fend for themselves and come up with a working solution. While many projects offer some set of tools to work with their codes, to launch jobs remotely or to setup input files, most of these tools are rarely integrated in a holistic way to provide an easy, common and high-productivity environment for users. For that matter, most remote jobs are launched on the machine in the other room, but that certainly will not work for larger problems that require Leadership Class computing resources found only at U.S. National Laboratories or similar facilities. Overcoming the challenges of launching on these machines and even on public or private clouds are left as a challenge to the user.","laborHours":0,"name":"The NEAMS Integrated Computational Environment (NiCE)","organization":"ORNL","permissions":{"exemptionText":null,"licenses":[{"URL":"https://github.com/eclipse/ice/blob/master/LICENSE","name":"Other"}],"usageType":"openSource"},"repositoryURL":"https://github.com/eclipse/ice","status":"Production","tags":["doecode","Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL)"],"vcs":"git","id":"DOE/The%20NEAMS%20Integrated%20Computational%20Environment%20(NiCE)","agency":"DOE"},"DOE/Myrmics%20Memory%20Allocator":{"contact":{"email":"holdensanchez2@llnl.gov"},"date":{"created":"2017-10-25","metadataLastUpdated":"2017-10-25"},"description":"MMA is a stand-alone memory management system for MPI clusters.

An engineer or scientist can utilize the equation solvers within MOOSE to solve equations related to their area of study. For instance, a geomechanical scientist can input equations related to water flow in underground reservoirs and MOOSE can solve those equations to give the scientist an idea of how water could move over time. An engineer might input equations related to the forces in steel beams in order to understand the load bearing capacity of a bridge.

UPC++ includes two main features beyond UPC: 1) One of the major limitations of UPC in the context of DOE application is the relatively weak notion of multidimensional arrays, which it inherited from C. To remedy this problem in UPC++, we included a multidimensional domain and array library based on that of Titanium. Titanium's library is similar to Chapel's dense and strided domains, as both were inspired by the dense and strided regions and arrays in ZPL. 2) Another feature provided by UPC++ but not by UPC is remote function invocation, which is inspired by Phalanx, X10, Habanero-C, and C++11. The user may start an asynchronous remote function invocation with the following syntax: \"async(place)(function, args...);\". UPC++ provides two programming constructs for specifying dynamic dependencies among tasks: 1) event-driven execution as in Phalanx and Habanero-C; 2) finish-async as in X10. We implemented UPC++ with a \"compiler-free\" approach using C++ templates and runtime libraries. The UPC++ front-end consists of a set of C++ header files that enables the C++ compiler to \"translate\" UPC++ features in a user program to runtime library calls.

Safe operations can be enhanced by correct design of device-level control algorithms, and protocols, procedures and operator training at the control-room level, but all can fail. Moreover, these elements exchange data and issue commands via vulnerable communication layers. In order to secure these gaps and enhance operational safety, we believe monitoring of command sequences must be combined with an awareness of physical device limitations and automata models that capture safety mechanisms. One way of doing this is by leveraging specification-based intrusion detection to monitor for physical constraint violations. The method can also verify that physical infrastructure state is consistent with monitoring information and control commands exchanged between field devices and control centers. This additional security layer enhances protection from both outsider attacks and insider mistakes. We implemented specification-based SCADA command analyzers using physical constraint algorithms directly in the Bro framework and Broccoli APIs for three separate scenarios: a water heater, an automated distribution system, and an over-current protection scheme. To accomplish this, we added low-level analyzers capable of examining control system-specific protocol packets for both Modbus TCP and DNP3, and also higher-level analyzers able to interpret device command and data streams within the context of each device's physical capabilities and present operational state. Thus the software that we are making available includes the Bro/Broccoli scripts for these three scenarios, as well as simulators, written in C, of those scenarios that generate sample traffic that is monitored by the Bro/Broccoli scripts. In addition, we have also implemented systems to directly pull cyber-physical information from the OSIsoft PI historian system. We have included the Python scripts used to perform that monitoring.","laborHours":0,"name":"HC-NIDS: signatures and simulations for detecting cyber-attacks aiming to cause damage against cyber-physical energy systems","organization":"LBNL","permissions":{"exemptionText":null,"licenses":[{"URL":"https://github.com/lbnl-cybersecurity/LBNL_Physics_Based_IDS/blob/master/LICENSE.txt","name":"Other"}],"usageType":"openSource"},"repositoryURL":"https://github.com/lbnl-cybersecurity/LBNL_Physics_Based_IDS","status":"Production","tags":["doecode","Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL)"],"vcs":"git","id":"DOE/HC-NIDS%3A%20signatures%20and%20simulations%20for%20detecting%20cyber-attacks%20aiming%20to%20cause%20damage%20against%20cyber-physical%20energy%20systems","agency":"DOE"},"DOE/minimega%20v.%203.0":{"contact":{"email":"jcrouch@sandia.gov"},"date":{"created":"2017-10-25","metadataLastUpdated":"2017-10-25"},"description":"minimega is an emulytics platform for creating testbeds of networked devices.

The algorithms consist of data parallel aware filters that can efficiently utilizes[sic] resources and can work on out of core datasets and scale efficiently across multiple accelerators. Optimizing for data parallel filters, streaming out of core datasets, and efficient resource and memory and data managements over complex execution sequence of filters greatly expedites any scientific workflow with image processing requirements. F3D performs several different types of 3D image processing operations, such as non-linear filtering using bilateral filtering and/or median filtering and/or morphological operators (MM). F3D gray-level MM operators are one-pass constant time methods that can perform morphological transformations with a line-structuring element oriented in discrete directions. Additionally, MM operators can be applied to gray-scale images, and consist of two parts: (a) a reference shape or structuring element, which is translated over the image, and (b) a mechanism, or operation, that defines the comparisons to be performed between the image and the structuring element. This tool provides a critical component within many complex pipelines such as those for performing automated segmentation of image stacks.

McKenna, \"A multiresolution spatial parameterization for the estimation of fossil-fuel carbon dioxide emissions via atmospheric inversions\", accepted, Geoscientific Model Development, 2014. The software can be used to estimate emissions of non-reactive gases such as fossil-fuel CO2, methane etc. The software uses a proxy of the emission field being estimated (e.g., for fossil-fuel CO2, a population density map is a good proxy) to construct a wavelet model for the emission field. It then uses a shrinkage regression algorithm called Stagewise Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (StOMP) to fit the wavelet model to concentration measurements, using an atmospheric transport model to relate emission and concentration fields. Algorithmic novelties described in the paper above (1) ensure that the estimated emission fields are non-negative, (2) allow the use of guesses for emission fields to accelerate the estimation processes and (3) ensure that under/overestimates in the guesses do not skew the estimation.","homepageURL":"http://www.sandia.gov/~jairay/kfcs/kfcs.html","laborHours":0,"name":"sparse-msrf:A package for sparse modeling and estimation of fossil-fuel CO2 emission fields","organization":"SNL","permissions":{"exemptionText":null,"licenses":[{"URL":"http://www.sandia.gov/~jairay/kfcs/kfcs.html","name":"Other"}],"usageType":"openSource"},"repositoryURL":"http://www.sandia.gov/~jairay/kfcs/kfcs.html","status":"Production","tags":["doecode","Sandia National Laboratories (SNL)"],"id":"DOE/sparse-msrf%3AA%20package%20for%20sparse%20modeling%20and%20estimation%20of%20fossil-fuel%20CO2%20emission%20fields","agency":"DOE"},"DOE/Domi":{"contact":{"email":"jcrouch@sandia.gov"},"date":{"created":"2017-10-25","metadataLastUpdated":"2017-10-25"},"description":"Domi (Greek for \"structure\") is a Trilinos package that provides support for multi-dimensional data arrays distributed over multiple processors of a high performance computing system.

This allows a highly flexible and dynamic means of creating highly complex actors without the code complexity (it also helps overcome the lack of multiple inheritance in Java.) All classes are highly customizable and there are abstract classes which are intended to be subclassed to allow a developer to create more complex and highly performant actors. There are multiple demos included in the framework to help the developer get started and shows off nearly all of the functionality. Some simple shapes (actors) are already created for you such as text, bordered text, radial text, text area, complex paths, NURBS paths, cube, disk, grid, plane, geometric shapes, and volumetric area.

The trend of widening vector registers adversely affects the state-of-the-art sequence alignment algorithm based on striped data layouts.

Though microbial community profiling methods have emerged to attempt to rapidly classify the millions of reads output from contemporary sequencers, the combination of incomplete databases, similarity among otherwise divergent genomes, and the large volumes of sequencing data required for metagenome sequencing has led to unacceptably high false discovery rates (FDR). Here we present the application of a novel, gene-independent and signature-based metagenomic taxonomic profiling tool with significantly smaller FDR, which is also capable of classifying never-before seen genomes into the appropriate parent taxa.The algorithm is based upon three primary computational phases: (I) genomic decomposition into bit vectors, (II) bit vector intersections to identify shared regions, and (III) bit vector subtractions to remove shared regions and reveal unique, signature regions. In the Decomposition phase, genomic data is first masked to highlight only the valid (non-ambiguous) regions and then decomposed into overlapping 24-mers. The k-mers are sorted along with their start positions, de-replicated, and then prefixed, to minimize data duplication. The prefixes are indexed and an identical data structure is created for the start positions to mimic that of the k-mer data structure. During the Intersection phase -- which is the most computationally intensive phase -- as an all-vs-all comparison is made, the number of comparisons is first reduced by four methods: (a) Prefix restriction, (b) Overlap detection, (c) Overlap restriction, and (d) Result recording. In Prefix restriction, only k-mers of the same prefix are compared. Within that group, potential overlap of k-mer suffixes that would result in a non-empty set intersection are screened for. If such an overlap exists, the region which intersects is first reduced by performing a binary search of the boundary suffixes of the smaller set into the larger set, which defines the limits of the zipper-based intersection process. Rather than recording the actual k-mers of the intersection, another data structure of identical \"shape\" is created which consists of only bit vectors so that only a 1 or 0 will be stored in the location of the k-mer suffix that was found in the intersection. This reduces the amount of data generated and stored considerably. During the Subtraction phase, relevant intersection bitmasks are first unionized together to form a single bitmask which is then applied over the original genome to reveal only those regions of the genome that are unique. These regions are then exported to disk in FASTA format and used in the application of determining the constituents of an unknown metagenomic community.","laborHours":0,"name":"GOTTCHA, Version 1","organization":"LANL","permissions":{"exemptionText":null,"licenses":[{"URL":"https://api.github.com/licenses/gpl-3.0","name":"GPL-3.0"}],"usageType":"openSource"},"repositoryURL":"https://github.com/losalamos/GOTTCHA","status":"Production","tags":["doecode","Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL)"],"vcs":"git","id":"DOE/GOTTCHA%2C%20Version%201","agency":"DOE"},"DOE/GOTTCHA%20Database%2C%20Version%201":{"contact":{"email":"kathleen_m@lanl.gov"},"date":{"created":"2017-10-25","metadataLastUpdated":"2017-10-25"},"description":"One major challenge in the field of shotgun metagenomics is the accurate identification of the organisms present within the community, based on classification of short sequence reads.

However, each particular software uses its own particular format and layout, for the output data. This makes it difficult to compare the results of different simulation software, or to have a common visualization tool for these results. However, a standardized layout for fields and particles has recently been developed: the openPMD format ( HYPERLINK \"http://www.openpmd.org/\"www.openpmd.org) This format is open- source, and specifies a standard way in which field data and particle data should be written. The openPMD format is already implemented in the particle-in-cell code Warp (developed at LBL) and in PIConGPU (developed at HZDR, Germany). In this context, the proposed software (openPMD-viewer) is a Python package, which allows to access and visualize any data which has been formatted according to the openPMD standard. This package contains two main components: - a Python API, which allows to read and extract the data from a openPMD file, so as to be able to work with it within the Python environment. (e.g. plot the data and reprocess it with particular Python functions) - a graphical interface, which works with the ipython notebook, and allows to quickly visualize the data and browse through a set of openPMD files. The proposed software will be typically used when analyzing the results of numerical simulations. It will be useful to quickly extract scientific meaning from a set of numerical data.","laborHours":0,"name":"openPMD-viewer","organization":"LLNL","permissions":{"exemptionText":null,"licenses":[{"URL":"https://github.com/openPMD/openPMD-viewer/blob/master/LICENSE.txt","name":"Other"}],"usageType":"openSource"},"repositoryURL":"https://github.com/openPMD/openPMD-viewer","status":"Production","tags":["doecode","Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL)"],"vcs":"git","id":"DOE/openPMD-viewer","agency":"DOE"},"DOE/Volttron%20version%203.x":{"contact":{"email":"david.long@pnnl.gov"},"date":{"created":"2017-10-25","metadataLastUpdated":"2017-10-25"},"description":"VOLTTRON™ is an agent execution platform providing services to its agents that allow them to easily communicate with physical devices and other resources.

Texas, NASA, and Oak Ridge National Labs. Specific to Sandia's contributions, the Cantera Electrolyte Thermo Objects (CETO) packages is comprised of add-on routines for Cantera that handle electrolyte thermochemistry and reactions within the overall Cantera package. Cantera is a C++ Cal Tech code that handles gas phase species transport, reaction, and thermodynamics. With this addition, Cantera can be extended to handle problems involving liquid phase reactions and transport in electrolyte systems, and phase equilibrium problemsinvolving concentrated electrolytes and gas/solid phases. A full treatment of molten salt thermodynamics and transport has also been implemented in CETO. The routines themselves consist of .cpp and .h files containing C++ objects that are derived from parent Cantera objects representing thermodynamic functions. They are linked unto the main Cantera libraries when requested by the user. As an addendum to the main thermodynamics objects, several utility applications are provided. The first is multiphase Gibbs free energy minimizer based on the vcs algorithm, called vcs_cantera. This code allows for the calculation of thermodynamic equilibrium in multiple phases at constant temperature and pressure. Note, a similar code capability exists already in Cantera. This version follows the same algorithm, but gas a different code-base starting point, and is used as a research tool for algorithm development. The second program, cttables, prints out tables of thermodynamic and kinetic information for thermodynamic and kinetic objects within Cantera. This program serves as a \"Get the numbers out\" utility for Cantera, and as such it is very useful as a verification tool.

RVA is designed to provide support in the visualization and analysis of complex reservoirs being managed using multi-fluid EOR techniques. RVA, for Reservoir Visualization and Analysis, was developed at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, with contributions from the Illinois State Geological Survey, Department of Computer Science and National Center for Supercomputing Applications. RVA was designed to utilize and enhance the state-of-the-art visualization capabilities within ParaView, readily allowing joint visualization of geologic framework and reservoir fluid simulation model results. Particular emphasis was placed on enabling visualization and analysis of simulation results highlighting multiple fluid phases, multiple properties for each fluid phase (including flow lines), multiple geologic models and multiple time steps. Additional advanced functionality was provided through the development of custom code to implement data mining capabilities. The built-in functionality of ParaView provides the capacity to process and visualize data sets ranging from small models on local desktop systems to extremely large models created and stored on remote supercomputers. The RVA plugin that we developed and the associated User Manual provide improved functionality through new software tools, and instruction in the use of ParaView-RVA, targeted to petroleum engineers and geologists in industry and research. The RVA web site (http://rva.cs.illinois.edu) provides an overview of functions, and the development web site (https://github.com/shaffer1/RVA) provides ready access to the source code, compiled binaries, user manual, and a suite of demonstration data sets. Key functionality has been included to support a range of reservoirs visualization and analysis needs, including: sophisticated connectivity analysis, cross sections through simulation results between selected wells, simplified volumetric calculations, global vertical exaggeration adjustments, ingestion of UTChem simulation results, ingestion of Isatis geostatistical framework models, interrogation of joint geologic and reservoir modeling results, joint visualization and analysis of well history files, location-targeted visualization, advanced correlation analysis, visualization of flow paths, and creation of static images and animations highlighting targeted reservoir features.","laborHours":0,"name":"RVA: A Plugin for ParaView 3.14","organization":"NETL","permissions":{"exemptionText":null,"licenses":[{"URL":"https://github.com/shaffer1/RVA/blob/master/Copyright.txt","name":"Other"}],"usageType":"openSource"},"repositoryURL":"https://github.com/shaffer1/RVA","status":"Production","tags":["doecode","National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL)"],"vcs":"git","id":"DOE/RVA%3A%20A%20Plugin%20for%20ParaView%203.14","agency":"DOE"},"DOE/Basic%20Matrix%20Library%20(bml)%2C%20Version%200.x":{"contact":{"email":"kathleen_m@lanl.gov"},"date":{"created":"2017-10-25","metadataLastUpdated":"2017-10-25"},"description":"The basic matrix library (bml) is a collection of various matrix data formats (in dense and sparse) and their associated algorithms for basic matrix operations.","laborHours":0,"name":"Basic Matrix Library (bml), Version 0.x","organization":"LANL","permissions":{"exemptionText":null,"licenses":[{"URL":"https://github.com/lanl/bml/blob/master/LICENSE.md","name":"Other"}],"usageType":"openSource"},"repositoryURL":"https://github.com/qmmd/bml","status":"Production","tags":["doecode","Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL)"],"vcs":"git","id":"DOE/Basic%20Matrix%20Library%20(bml)%2C%20Version%200.x","agency":"DOE"},"DOE/GlobalSums%2C%20Version%201.x":{"contact":{"email":"kathleen_m@lanl.gov"},"date":{"created":"2017-10-25","metadataLastUpdated":"2017-10-25"},"description":"This code is a set of global sums to support the paper \"Computational Reproducibility for Production Physics Applications\" submitted to the Numerical Reproducibility at Exascale (NRE 2015) workshop at the 2015 Supercomputing conference, Nov. 20, 2015","laborHours":0,"name":"GlobalSums, Version 1.x","organization":"LANL","permissions":{"exemptionText":null,"licenses":[{"URL":"https://api.github.com/licenses/apache-2.0","name":"Apache-2.0"}],"usageType":"openSource"},"repositoryURL":"https://github.com/losalamos/GlobalSums","status":"Production","tags":["doecode","Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL)"],"vcs":"git","id":"DOE/GlobalSums%2C%20Version%201.x","agency":"DOE"},"DOE/Water%20Network%20Tool%20for%20Resilience%20v.%201.0":{"contact":{"email":"jcrouch@sandia.gov"},"date":{"created":"2017-10-25","metadataLastUpdated":"2017-10-25"},"description":"WNTR is a python package designed to simulate and analyze resilience of water distribution networks.

The first code, \"Automated RSM\", automates the generation of a drag coefficient RSM for a particular object to a single command. \"Automated RSM\" first creates a Latin Hypercube Sample (LHS) of 1,000 ensemble members to explore the global parameter space. For each ensemble member, a TPMC simulation is performed and the object drag coefficient is computed. In the next step of the \"Automated RSM\" code, a Gaussian process is used to fit the TPMC simulations. In the final step, Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is used to evaluate the non-analytic probability distribution function from the Gaussian process. The second code, \"RSM Area\", creates a look-up table for the projected area of the object based on input limits on the minimum and maximum allowed pitch and yaw angles and pitch and yaw angle intervals. The projected area from the look-up table is used to compute the ballistic coefficient of the object based on its pitch and yaw angle. An accurate ballistic coefficient is crucial in accurately computing the drag on an object. The third code, \"RSM Cd\", uses the RSM generated by the \"Automated RSM\" code and the projected area look-up table generated by the \"RSM Area\" code to accurately compute the drag coefficient and ballistic coefficient of the object. The user can modify the object velocity, object surface temperature, the translational temperature of the gas, the species concentrations of the gas, and the pitch and yaw angles of the object. Together, these codes allow for the accurate derivation of an object's drag coefficient and ballistic coefficient under any conditions with only knowledge of the object's geometry and mass.","laborHours":0,"name":"Response Surface Modeling Tool Suite, Version 1.x","organization":"LANL","permissions":{"exemptionText":null,"licenses":[{"URL":"https://api.github.com/licenses/gpl-2.0","name":"GPL-2.0"}],"usageType":"openSource"},"repositoryURL":"https://github.com/AndrewCWalker/rsm_tool_suite","status":"Production","tags":["doecode","Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL)"],"vcs":"git","id":"DOE/Response%20Surface%20Modeling%20Tool%20Suite%2C%20Version%201.x","agency":"DOE"},"DOE/Livermore%20Big%20Artificial%20Neural%20Network%20Toolkit":{"contact":{"email":"holdensanchez2@llnl.gov"},"date":{"created":"2017-10-25","metadataLastUpdated":"2017-10-25"},"description":"LBANN is a toolkit that is designed to train artificial neural networks efficiently on high performance computing architectures.

To date our current activities have focused on correct GPU code generation and thus we have not yet focused on improving overall performance. The compiler is implemented by recognizing specific (syntactic) Kokkos constructs in order to bypass normal template expansion mechanisms and instead use the semantic knowledge of Kokkos to directly generate code in the compiler’s intermediate representation (IR); which is then translated into an NVIDIA-centric GPU program and supporting runtime calls. In addition, by capturing and maintaining the higher-level semantics of Kokkos directly within the lower levels of the compiler has the potential for significantly improving the ability of the compiler to communicate with the developer in the terms of their original programming model/semantics.","laborHours":0,"name":"Kokkos GPU Compiler","organization":"LANL","permissions":{"exemptionText":null,"licenses":[{"URL":"https://github.com/lanl/kokkos-clang/blob/master/LICENSE","name":"Other"}],"usageType":"openSource"},"repositoryURL":"https://github.com/losalamos/kokkos-clang","status":"Production","tags":["doecode","Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL)"],"vcs":"git","id":"DOE/Kokkos%20GPU%20Compiler","agency":"DOE"},"DOE/FASTQ%20quality%20control%20dashboard":{"contact":{"email":"david.long@pnnl.gov"},"date":{"created":"2017-10-25","metadataLastUpdated":"2017-10-25"},"description":"FQCDB builds up existing open source software, FastQC, implementing a modern web interface for across parsed output of FastQC.

Suppose we need to estimate the spatial distribution of variable X with high spatial resolution. The available data include (1) direct measurements Z of the unknowns with high resolution in a subset of the spatial domain (small spatial coverage), (2) measurements C of the unknowns at the median scale, and (3) measurements A of the unknowns at the coarsest scale but with large spatial coverage. The goal is to estimate the unknowns at the fine grids by conditioning to all the available data. We first consider all the unknowns as random variables and estimate conditional probability distribution of those variables by conditioning to the limited high-resolution observations (Z). We then treat the estimated probability distribution as the prior distribution. Within the Bayesian framework, we combine the median and large-scale measurements (C and A) through likelihood functions.

Given a function of the form f : R^d -> R, a level set is defined as an inverse image f^-1(h) for an isovalue h, and a contour is a single connected component of a level set. The Reeb graph can then be defined to be the result of contracting each contour to a single point, and is well defined for Euclidean spaces or for general manifolds. For simple domains, the graph is guaranteed to be a tree, and is called the contour tree. Analysis can then be performed on the contour tree in order to identify isovalues of particular interest, based on various metrics, and render the corresponding contours, without having to know such isovalues a priori. This code is intended to be the first data-parallel algorithm for computing contour trees. Our implementation will use the portable data-parallel primitives provided by Nvidia’s Thrust library, allowing us to compile our same code for both GPUs and multi-core CPUs.

An important area of active research in pure mathematics is determining which graphs are determined by their spectra, i.e. when the spectrum of the adjacency matrix uniquely determines the underlying graph. We are interested in exploring the spectra of graphs in the Johnson scheme and specifically seek to determine which of these graphs are determined by their spectra. Given a graph G, a Godsil-McKay switching set is an induced subgraph H on 2k vertices with the following properties: I) H is regular, ii) every vertex in G/H is adjacent to either 0, k, or 2k vertices of H, and iii) at least one vertex in G/H is adjacent to k vertices in H. The software package examines each subset of a user specified size to determine whether or not it satisfies those 3 conditions. The software makes use of the massive parallel processing power of CUDA enabled GPUs. It also exploits the vertex transitivity of graphs in the Johnson scheme by reasoning that if G has a Godsil-McKay switching set, then it has a switching set which includes vertex 1. While the code (in its current state) is tuned to this specific problem, the method of examining each induced subgraph of G can be easily re-written to check for any user specified conditions on the subgraphs and can therefore be used much more broadly.","laborHours":0,"name":"CUDA Enabled Graph Subset Examiner","organization":"ORNL","permissions":{"exemptionText":null,"licenses":[{"URL":"https://github.com/jtjohnston/computational_combinatorics/blob/master/GM-switching/LICENSE","name":"Other"}],"usageType":"openSource"},"repositoryURL":"https://github.com/jtjohnston/computational_combinatorics/","status":"Production","tags":["doecode","Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL)"],"vcs":"git","id":"DOE/CUDA%20Enabled%20Graph%20Subset%20Examiner","agency":"DOE"},"DOE/XACC%20-%20eXtreme-scale%20Accelerator%20Programming%20Framework":{"contact":{"email":"laymancelk@ornl.gov"},"date":{"created":"2017-10-25","metadataLastUpdated":"2017-10-25"},"description":"Hybrid programming models for beyond-CMOS technologies will prove critical for integrating new computing technologies alongside our existing infrastructure.

Workflows become much more complex because they must seamlessly integrate simulation and data analytics. They must include down-sampling, post-processing, feature extraction, and visualization. Power and data transfer limitations require these analysis tasks to be run in-situ or in-transit. We expect successful workflows will comprise multiple linked simulations along with tens of analysis routines. Users will have limited development time at scale and, therefore, must have rich tools to develop, debug, test, and deploy applications. At this scale, successful workflows will compose linked computations from an assortment of reliable, well-defined computation elements, ones that can come and go as required, based on the needs of the workflow over time. We propose a novel framework that utilizes both virtual machines (VMs) and software containers to create a workflow system that establishes a uniform build and execution environment (BEE) beyond the capabilities of current systems. In this environment, applications will run reliably and repeatably across heterogeneous hardware and software. Containers, both commercial (Docker and Rocket) and open-source (LXC and LXD), define a runtime that isolates all software dependencies from the machine operating system. Workflows may contain multiple containers that run different operating systems, different software, and even different versions of the same software. We will run containers in open-source virtual machines (KVM) and emulators (QEMU) so that workflows run on any machine entirely in user-space. On this platform of containers and virtual machines, we will deliver workflow software that provides services, including repeatable execution, provenance, checkpointing, and future proofing. We will capture provenance about how containers were launched and how they interact to annotate workflows for repeatable and partial re-execution. We will coordinate the physical snapshots of virtual machines with parallel programming constructs, such as barriers, to automate checkpoint and restart. We will also integrate with HPC-specific container runtimes to gain access to accelerators and other specialized hardware to preserve native performance. Containers will link development to continuous integration. When application developers check code in, it will automatically be tested on a suite of different software and hardware architectures.","laborHours":0,"name":"Build and Execute Environment","organization":"LANL","permissions":{"exemptionText":null,"licenses":[{"URL":"https://github.com/lanl/BEE/blob/master/LICENSE","name":"Other"}],"usageType":"openSource"},"repositoryURL":"https://github.com/lanl/BEE","status":"Production","tags":["doecode","Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL)"],"vcs":"git","id":"DOE/Build%20and%20Execute%20Environment","agency":"DOE"},"DOE/colormap_util":{"contact":{"email":"david.long@pnnl.gov"},"date":{"created":"2017-10-25","metadataLastUpdated":"2017-10-25"},"description":"Our Python module, colormap_module, presented here can be used to analyze and manipulate colormaps and has two main aims: (i) compare existing and new custom colormaps quantitatively by comparing their values in a color space, called CAM02-UCS, that directly shows how a human perceives their hue, saturation, and lightness values and (ii) create isoluminant colormaps from existing or custom colormaps and (iii) mix isoluminant colormap data with a 4th dimension of data by manipulating lightness values across the image and present the new image.

Key functions include: 1. Creating (typically by installing an operating system from vendor media) and updating VM images; 2. Running a single VM; 3. Running multiple VMs in a virtual cluster. The virtual machines can talk to one another over the network and (in some cases) the outside world. This is accomplished by calling external programs such as QEMU and the Virtual Distributed Ethernet (VDE) suite. The goal is to let users have a virtual cluster containing nodes where they have privileged access, while isolating that privilege within the virtual cluster so it cannot affect the physical compute resources. Host configuration enforces security; this is not included in Charliecloud, though security guidelines are included in its documentation and Charliecloud is designed to facilitate such configuration. Charliecloud manages passing information from host computers into and out of the virtual machines, such as parameters of the virtual cluster, input data specified by the user, output data from virtual compute jobs, VM console display, and network connections (e.g., SSH or X11). Parameters for the virtual cluster (number of VMs, RAM and disk per VM, etc.) are specified by the user or gathered from the environment (e.g., SLURM environment variables). Example job scripts are included. These include computation examples (such as a \"hello world\" MPI job) as well as performance tests. They also include a security test script to verify that the virtual cluster is appropriately sandboxed. Tests include: 1. Pinging hosts inside and outside the virtual cluster to explore connectivity; 2. Port scans (again inside and outside) to see what services are available; 3. Sniffing tests to see what traffic is visible to running VMs; 4. IP address spoofing to test network functionality in this case; 5. File access tests to make sure host access permissions are enforced. This test script is not a comprehensive scanner and does not test for specific vulnerabilities. Importantly, no information about physical hosts or network topology is included in this script (or any of Charliecloud); while part of a sensible test, such information is specified by the user when the test is run.

CICE has several interacting components: a vertical thermodynamic model that computes local growth rates of snow and ice due to vertical conductive, radiative and turbulent fluxes, along with snowfall; an elastic-viscous-plastic model of ice dynamics, which predicts the velocity field of the ice pack based on a model of the material strength of the ice; an incremental remapping transport model that describes horizontal advection of the areal concentration, ice and snow volume and other state variables; and a ridging parameterization that transfers ice among thickness categories based on energetic balances and rates of strain.

The goal of Amesos is to make AX=S as easy as it sounds, at least for direct methods. Amesos provides interfaces to a number of third party sparse direct solvers, including SuperLU, SuperLU MPI, DSCPACK, UMFPACK and KLU. Amesos provides a common object oriented interface to the best sparse direct solvers in the world. A sparse direct solver solves for x in Ax = b. where A is a matrix and x and b are vectors (or multi-vectors). A sparse direct solver flrst factors A into trinagular matrices L and U such that A = LU via gaussian elimination and then solves LU x = b. Switching amongst solvers in Amesos roquires a change to a single parameter. Yet, no solver needs to be linked it, unless it is used. All conversions between the matrices provided by the user and the format required by the underlying solver is performed by Amesos. As new sparse direct solvers are created, they will be incorporated into Amesos, allowing the user to simpty link with the new solver, change a single parameter in the calling sequence, and use the new solver. Amesos allows users to specify whether the matrix has changed. Amesos can be used anywhere that any sparse direct solver is needed.","laborHours":0,"name":"Amesos Solver Package","organization":"SNL","permissions":{"exemptionText":null,"licenses":[{"URL":"https://api.github.com/licenses/lgpl-2.1","name":"LGPL-2.1"}],"usageType":"openSource"},"repositoryURL":"https://github.com/trilinos/Trilinos/","status":"Production","tags":["doecode","Sandia National Laboratories (SNL)"],"vcs":"git","id":"DOE/Amesos%20Solver%20Package","agency":"DOE"},"DOE/MRSH%20Version%20V2.0":{"contact":{"email":"holdensanchez2@llnl.gov"},"date":{"created":"2017-10-25","metadataLastUpdated":"2017-10-25"},"description":"The MRSH project is a collection of the following programs: MRSH, MRCP, MRLOGIN, MRSHD, MRLOGIND.

In its first stage, Stride Search performs a spatial search of the data set at each timestep by dividing a search domain into circular sectors of constant geodesic radius. Data from a netCDF file is read into memory for each circular search sector. If the data meet or exceed a set of storm identification criteria (defined by the user), a storm is recorded to a linked list. Finally, the linked list is examined and duplicate detections of the same storm are removed and the results are written to an output file. The first stage’s output file is read by a second program that builds storm. Additional identification criteria may be applied at this stage to further classify storms.

With CanTrilBat, we are developing predictive phenomenological models for battery systems to predict operating performance and rate limiting steps in the performance of battery models. Particular attention is paid to primary and secondary chemistry mechanisms, such as the thermal runaway mechanisms experienced in secondary lithium ion batteries or self-discharge reaction mechanism that all batteries experience to one extent or another. The first application of this model has been for modeling the performance of thermal batteries. However, an implementation for secondary ion batteries is next. CanTrilBat applications solves transient problems involving batteries. It is a 1-D application that represents 3-D physical systems that can be reduced using the porous flow approximation for the anode, cathode, and separator. A control volume formulation is used to track conserved quantities. An operator-split approach is used to calculate the chemistry, diffusion and electronic transport that occurs within cathode and anode particles, allowing for the reduction in code complexity. All jacobian operations in CanTrilBat utilize numerical jacobians. A home grown predictor corrector scheme is used for time step control, and a home grown newton solver is used to relax the equations at each time step. Trilinos is used to solve for the resulting linear systems equation A block text input format is used to initialize options for the CanTriBat program. Within this block are the names of several XML input files, which specify the chemistry mechanism. These XML input files are read by low level Cantera routines, and serve to initialize the electrode and electrolyte chemistry mechanisms and transport properties. A GUI implementation has been contracted out to a university professor, but has not been implemented yet. It?s expected that CanTriBat will have the capability to do adaptive grid refinement in later versions.

The software can solve basic MPM problems in solid mechanics using the original algorithm of Sulsky with explicit time integration, basic geometries, and free-slip and no-slip boundary conditions as described in the reference. ExaMPM is intended to be used as a starting point to design new parallel algorithms for the next generation of DOE supercomputers.","laborHours":0,"name":"ExaMPM","organization":"ORNL","permissions":{"exemptionText":null,"licenses":[{"URL":"https://github.com/ECP-copa/ExaMPM","name":"Other"}],"usageType":"openSource"},"repositoryURL":"https://github.com/ECP-copa/ExaMPM","status":"Production","tags":["doecode","Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL)"],"vcs":"git","id":"DOE/ExaMPM","agency":"DOE"},"DOE/Solergy%20(Beta%20Version%201)":{"contact":{"email":"jcrouch@sandia.gov"},"date":{"created":"2017-10-25","metadataLastUpdated":"2017-12-13"},"description":"SOLERGY simulates the operation and power output of a user-defined solar central receiver power plant for a time period of up to one year.

We present 3 main software components that attack the island detection problem on two different bases: 1) the preference of islands to insert in chromosomal tRNA or tmRNA genes (islander.pl), and 2) islands' sporadic occurrence among closely related strains. The latter principle is employed in both an algorithm (learnedPhyloblocks.pl) and a visualization method (panGenome.pl). Component islander.pl finds islands based on their preference for a particular target gene type. We annotate each tRNA and tmRNA gene, find fragments of each such gene as candidates for the distal ends of islands, and filter candidates to remove false positives. Component learnedPhyloblocks.pl uses islands found by islander.pl and other methods as a training set to find new islands. Reference genomes are aligned using mugsy, then the \"phylotypes\" or patterns of occurrence in the reference set are determined for each position in the target genome, and those phylotypes most enriched in the training set of islands are followed to detect yet more islands. Component panGenome.pl produces a big-data visualization of the chromosomally-ordered \"pan-genome\", that includes every gene of every reference genome (x-axis, pan-genome order; y-axis, reference genomes; color-coding, gene presence/absence etc.), islands appearing as dark patches.","homepageURL":"http://bioinformatics.sandia.gov/software/","laborHours":0,"name":"Genomic Island Identification Software v 1.0","organization":"SNL","permissions":{"exemptionText":null,"licenses":[{"URL":"http://bioinformatics.sandia.gov/software/","name":"Other"}],"usageType":"openSource"},"repositoryURL":"http://bioinformatics.sandia.gov/software/","status":"Production","tags":["doecode","Sandia National Laboratories (SNL)"],"id":"DOE/Genomic%20Island%20Identification%20Software%20v%201.0","agency":"DOE"},"DOE/ForQint":{"contact":{"email":"jcrouch@sandia.gov"},"date":{"created":"2017-10-25","metadataLastUpdated":"2017-12-13"},"description":"ForQint is a Fortran software library to adaptively integrate multivariable functions versus well known probability distributions (e.g. normal, lognormal, etc.) using quadrature rules.

Title 31, United States Code, Section 3720B bars â€œdelinquent Federal debtors from obtaining Federal loans or loan insurance guarantees.â€ In 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) mandated that all Federal Credit agencies prescreen all applicants for non-delinquency in Federal debt, through a system of shared data, where practical. In 1990, CAIVRS expanded to include delinquent Federal borrower data from agencies other than HUD, including; USDA, VA, SBA, FDIC, and the Departments of Education and Justice.

The FASS-FHA system collects annual project financial statement information to assess the project's financial performance and compliance and has accepted and assessed over 78,000 electronic submissions of Annual Financial Statement (AFS) data since October of 1998. It identifies financial risks and compliance deficiencies in need of loss mitigation or enforcement actions by the Office of Housing (Housing) or Enforcement Center (EC). The financial data collected by REAC, Housing and EC as well as other HUD program offices, is used to assess multifamily properties for non-compliance and poor performance. The automated assessments and on-line analysis provided by FASS-FHA assists HUD's limited program monitoring and enforcement staff in prioritizing review of properties. The FASS-FHA system is responsible for eliminating time consuming and costly clearinghouse collection and manual assessment efforts previously performed by HUD contractors and field staff.

The new HUD 2020 Management Reform Plan included, among other changes, the establishment of the Public and Indian Housing - Real Estate Assessment Center (PIH-REAC). PIH-REAC is an information-intensive HUD operation that evaluates the performance of field entities managing or owning housing in which the Department has either a financial interest or a statutory monitoring obligation. (Note that the majority of these properties are public housing or multifamily properties.) As part of this Enterprise-Wide Strategic Plan, HUD made three decisions that require most significant transformations of the FASS-PH program that have ever been undertaken. One decision is that it will take a quantum leap in its effort to improve the granularity of its monitoring of local Public Housing Authorities (PHAs). A second is that it will start using, and eventually migrate all of its stored data to Oracle. Third, it will shift to using an open source, Java-based programming language, often called J2EE (completed). The decision has been made to create a more transparent reporting system that will provide a greater level of granularities at the property level. The objective is to collect expenses and revenues from a Project Based Management (PBM) perspective â€“ specifically by dividing the properties managed by individual Public Housing Agencies/Authorities (PHAs) into more manageable sized groupings called Asset Management Projects (AMPs). To help implement this, HUD will also encourage the creation of a Central Office Cost Center (COCC) for each PHA with more than one AMP. These COCCs (or private management companies) will serve as the vehicle through which a PHA can provide administrative and maintenance services to its AMPs, and through which it can keep an accounting of the expenditures for those services (conversion to AMP completed). As a result of these changes, the FASS-PH software will have to be changed to capture, evaluate and grade the new financial information being submitted by the PHAs. This will require a number of new financial data input screens for PHAs, evaluation screens for Real Estate Assessment Center (REAC) Staff, and the back-end processes that drive these and other submission-scoring operations.

This allows HUD to target risks while making the best use of the Department?s limited resources.

Releases 1, 2, 3 and 4 have been previously implemented into production. Releases 5 and 6 carry all SDM phases of the MASS initiative into FY 2002. Release 5 was developed to support the REAC invalidation process, improve the evaluative nature of the current management indicators, enhance navigation and improve the current pages with updated and/or new information.

Objectives for IOD are that it will: â€¢ Become a central resource for PD&R to analyze emerging trends, issues, and solutions. â€¢ Spur HUD HQ, field, and regional offices to engage with innovations occurring within their jurisdictionâ€“improving participation, a sense of ownership, connectivity, and morale across the agency. â€¢ Engage domestic and international innovators from public, private, and social sectors in sharing best practices and models â€¢ Generate philanthropic interest, collaborations and/or investment. â€¢ Be a meaningful external engagement tool, demonstrating HUD values new approaches and innovative practices in fulfilling its mission. The four components of IOD include: 1. An online submission form and innovations database: Anyone can submit innovations (HUD staff, local governments, multi-lateral organizations, non-profits, or the general public) to IOD though a straightforward submission form. Thereafter, an internal IOD committee will clear submissions for publishing based on established and OGC-approved criteria. Once cleared, innovations will populate a searchable database that can be filtered by HUD goals, major housing and urban development themes, geography, and/or innovation type. 2. Review and Edit Submitted Innovations An internal IOD committee will review all submitted innovations to validate text and photographs of the submissions. This system will be available internally to HUD staff. 3. Featured Innovation: The IOD committee will select key innovations to feature on the HUD.gov homepage slideshow and HUDuser.org, in addition to the Innovation of the Day landing page. These featured innovations will change/rotate on a weekly basis, enabling us to elevate specific innovations. For example, one week we may want to feature innovations related to homelessness, while another week sustainable communities. Additionally, featured innovations will be shared through social media, emails, and partner sitesâ€”the viral nature helping to fuel the overall initiative. 4. Trend Analysis and Dashboard Tool Anyone will be able to query the submitted innovations.

These sets of indicators are capable of transmitting and translating process performance, feedstock, utility, equipment, and output information into a quantifiable sustainability measurement scale. In addition, each indicator is mathematically defined, thus emphasizing realistic usage, and connecting the mathematical formulas for the indicators with their respective data requirements. \r\n \r\nGREENSCOPE can be applied to an entire process, to a piece of equipment or process unit, or at the investigatory bench scale. This versatility allows for a direct comparison between several processes manufacturing the same product but employing different raw materials, reaction processes, separation technologies, or producing different byproducts. In addition, the designer or the researcher can implement this methodology to evaluate the sustainability performance either before or after making process modifications. This resulting sustainability assessment describes quantifiably how well the system under consideration makes use of mass and energy inputs to manufacture a valuable product, at the same time meeting social and environmental needs, all the while maximizing its economic benefit.\r\n  \r\nCurrently, the GREENSCOPE Microsoft Excel version software tool is under clearance in STICS.

PiSCES utilizes distributional information obtained from Nature Serve, the USGS, and the Peterson Field Guide to Freshwater Fishes of North America for over 1,000 native and non-native freshwater fish species. In addition to these geographic distributions, users of PiSCES can filter potential fish assemblages based on species rarity, stream size preferences (as measured by mean stream width), and genera-specific occurrence envelopes for a variety of physicochemical stream properties (pH, conductivity, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, watershed area, mean width, depth, and slope). For a user-specified total number of fishes in the stream reach, PiSCES will create an abundance distribution for the posited community using a size spectrum approach that relates abundance to maximum body size. The PiSCES interface allows users to readily access its database to see ancillary characteristics of each species, such as habitat preferences (e.g., if the species prefers riffles, runs, or pools, sand or gravel substrate, etc.) and HUC-based distribution maps. PiSCES has been used in conjunction with an integrated environmental modeling system to simulate dynamics of stream fish communities in the Coal River, WV watershed.","tags":null,"contact":{"name":"Amber Ignatius","email":"Ignatius.Amber@epa.gov","phone":"(706) 355-0000"},"permissions":{"licenses":[{"URL":null,"name":null}],"usageType":"governmentWideReuse","exemptionText":null},"laborHours":null,"date":{"created":"","lastModified":"","metadataLastUpdated":""},"vcs":"","disclaimerText":"","disclaimerURL":"","relatedCode":[{"codeName":"","codeURL":"","isGovernmentRepo":false}],"reusedCode":[{"name":"","URL":""}],"id":"EPA/Piscine%20Stream%20Community%20Estimation%20System","agency":"EPA"},"EPA/Global%20SDG%20Indicators":{"organization":"ORD","name":"Global SDG Indicators","description":"Global SDG Indicators","tags":null,"contact":{"name":"Julia Ortiz","email":"Ortiz.Julia@epa.gov","phone":"(202) 564-1931"},"permissions":{"licenses":[{"URL":"N/A","name":null}],"usageType":"governmentWideReuse","exemptionText":null},"laborHours":null,"date":{"created":"","lastModified":"","metadataLastUpdated":""},"vcs":"","disclaimerText":"","disclaimerURL":"","relatedCode":[{"codeName":"","codeURL":"","isGovernmentRepo":false}],"reusedCode":[{"name":"","URL":""}],"id":"EPA/Global%20SDG%20Indicators","agency":"EPA"},"EPA/dev_1_fish_advisories":{"organization":"ORD","name":"dev_1_fish_advisories","description":"A simple smartphone app that allows user to view advisories relative to her/his location or by searching by body of water","tags":null,"contact":{"name":"Gregory Sayles","email":"Sayles.Gregory@epa.gov","phone":"(513) 569-7607"},"permissions":{"licenses":[{"URL":null,"name":null}],"usageType":"governmentWideReuse","exemptionText":null},"laborHours":null,"date":{"created":"","lastModified":"","metadataLastUpdated":""},"vcs":"","disclaimerText":"","disclaimerURL":"","relatedCode":[{"codeName":"","codeURL":"","isGovernmentRepo":false}],"reusedCode":[{"name":"","URL":""}],"id":"EPA/dev_1_fish_advisories","agency":"EPA"},"EPA/dev_4_sustainable_purchasing":{"organization":"IESD","name":"dev_4_sustainable_purchasing","description":"This app is built on an R model which calculates impacts across a number of metrics for various industries.

Together the finite element and aero tutorials can be used to compare to experimental studies such as ground vibration testing, cantilever beam analysis, as well as wind tunnel testing. The primary code, EZASE.m, links structures and aero together in a commented way to produce a wing in flutter which can be controlled. The wing may include control surfaces or they can be excluded.

The ultimate goal in designing this code was to achieve full rotor levitation and control at a loop time of 50 s.  Using a 1-GHz processor the code will control a five-axis system in either a decentralized or a more elegant centralized (model control) mode at loop time of 56  s.  In addition, it will levitate and control (with only minor modification to the input-output wiring) a two-axis and / or a four-axis system.  Stable rotor levitation and control of any of the system mentioned above are accomplished through appropriate key presses to modify parameters, such as stiffness, damping, and bias.  A signal generation block provides 11 excitation signals.  An excitation signal is then superimposed on the radial bearing x- and y- control signals, thus producing a resultant force vector.  By modulating the signals on the bearing x0 and y- axes with a cosine and sine function, respectively, a radial excitation force vector is made to rotate 360 about the bearing geometric center.  The rotation of the force vector is achieved manually by using key press or automatically by engaging the \" one-per-revolution\" feature.  Rotor rigid body modes can be excited by using the excitation module.  Depending on the polarities of the excitation signal in each radial bearing, the bounce or tilt mode will be excited.\r\n\r\nmagnetic bearings are an enabling technology for rotating devices with extremely high rotational speeds, such as flywheel energy storage systems being proposed for the International Space Station.  In addition these bearings have great potential for conventional gas turbine engines especially because the control algorithms can compensate for an event such as loss of a blade that causes rotor imbalance.","tags":["NASA","GRC","General Public Release","Design and Integration Tools"],"contact":{"email":"grc-sra-team@mail.nasa.gov"},"organization":"GRC","identifier":"LEW-17293-2","repositoryURL":"https://software.nasa.gov/software/LEW-17293-2","permissions":{"licenses":[{"URL":"https://software.nasa.gov/faq","name":"Pending Release"}],"usageType":"governmentWideReuse","exemptionText":null},"laborHours":0,"date":{"created":"","lastModified":"","metadataLastUpdated":"2015-9-9"},"id":"NASA/Software%20For%20System%20For%20Controlling%20A%20Magnetically%20Levitated%20Rotor","agency":"NASA"},"NASA/CSPAN%20Axial-Flow%20Compressor%20Conceptual%20Design%20Code":{"_id":{"$oid":"5a3a9b78da833f1e40fb60f6"},"name":"CSPAN Axial-Flow Compressor Conceptual Design Code","description":"This span-line analysis technology uses isentropic simple radial equilibrium to determine a flow path.","tags":["NASA","GRC","U.S. Government Purpose Release","Propulsion"],"contact":{"email":"grc-sra-team@mail.nasa.gov"},"organization":"GRC","identifier":"LEW-16074-1","repositoryURL":"https://software.nasa.gov/software/LEW-16074-1","permissions":{"licenses":[{"URL":"https://software.nasa.gov/faq","name":"Pending Release"}],"usageType":"governmentWideReuse","exemptionText":null},"laborHours":0,"date":{"created":"","lastModified":"","metadataLastUpdated":"2014-4-15"},"id":"NASA/CSPAN%20Axial-Flow%20Compressor%20Conceptual%20Design%20Code","agency":"NASA"},"NASA/Command%2C%20Control%2C%20Communications%2C%20and%20Intelligence%20(C3I)Delay%2FDisruption-Tolerant%20(DTN)%20Networking%20Software":{"_id":{"$oid":"5a3a9b78da833f1e40fb60f7"},"name":"Command, Control, Communications, and Intelligence (C3I)Delay/Disruption-Tolerant (DTN) Networking Software","description":"This code is a DTN implementation of the Constellation Program's C3I software.","tags":["NASA","GRC","U.S. Government Purpose Release","Operations"],"contact":{"email":"grc-sra-team@mail.nasa.gov"},"organization":"GRC","identifier":"LEW-18493-1","repositoryURL":"https://software.nasa.gov/software/LEW-18493-1","permissions":{"licenses":[{"URL":"https://software.nasa.gov/faq","name":"Pending Release"}],"usageType":"governmentWideReuse","exemptionText":null},"laborHours":0,"date":{"created":"","lastModified":"","metadataLastUpdated":"2014-4-15"},"id":"NASA/Command%2C%20Control%2C%20Communications%2C%20and%20Intelligence%20(C3I)Delay%2FDisruption-Tolerant%20(DTN)%20Networking%20Software","agency":"NASA"},"NASA/Command%2C%20Control%2C%20Communications%2C%20and%20Intelligence%20(C3I)%20Networking%20Software":{"_id":{"$oid":"5a3a9b78da833f1e40fb60f8"},"name":"Command, Control, Communications, and Intelligence (C3I) Networking Software","description":"This implementation of the Constellation Program's C3I software has provided an environment for the prototype testing of a variety of networking protocols.","tags":["NASA","GRC","U.S. Government Purpose Release","Operations"],"contact":{"email":"grc-sra-team@mail.nasa.gov"},"organization":"GRC","identifier":"LEW-18494-1","repositoryURL":"https://software.nasa.gov/software/LEW-18494-1","permissions":{"licenses":[{"URL":"https://software.nasa.gov/faq","name":"Pending Release"}],"usageType":"governmentWideReuse","exemptionText":null},"laborHours":0,"date":{"created":"","lastModified":"","metadataLastUpdated":"2014-4-15"},"id":"NASA/Command%2C%20Control%2C%20Communications%2C%20and%20Intelligence%20(C3I)%20Networking%20Software","agency":"NASA"},"NASA/Command%2C%20Control%2C%20Communications%2C%20and%20Intelligence%20(C3I)%20Voice%20Exchange%20Software":{"_id":{"$oid":"5a3a9b78da833f1e40fb60f9"},"name":"Command, Control, Communications, and Intelligence (C3I) Voice Exchange Software","description":"This implementation of the Constellation Program's C3I software has provided an environment for the prototype testing of a variety of voice exchange components.","tags":["NASA","GRC","U.S. Government Purpose Release","Operations"],"contact":{"email":"grc-sra-team@mail.nasa.gov"},"organization":"GRC","identifier":"LEW-18495-1","repositoryURL":"https://software.nasa.gov/software/LEW-18495-1","permissions":{"licenses":[{"URL":"https://software.nasa.gov/faq","name":"Pending Release"}],"usageType":"governmentWideReuse","exemptionText":null},"laborHours":0,"date":{"created":"","lastModified":"","metadataLastUpdated":"2014-4-15"},"id":"NASA/Command%2C%20Control%2C%20Communications%2C%20and%20Intelligence%20(C3I)%20Voice%20Exchange%20Software","agency":"NASA"},"NASA/Axial-Flow%20Turbine%20Off-Design%20(AXOD)%20Performance":{"_id":{"$oid":"5a3a9b78da833f1e40fb60fa"},"name":"Axial-Flow Turbine Off-Design (AXOD) Performance","description":"AXOD computes the flow and efficiency of multistage axial-flow turbines as functions of speed and pressure ratio.

The ultimate goal in designing this code was to achieve full rotor levitation and control at a loop time of 50 s.  Using a 1-GHz processor the code will control a five-axis system in either a decentralized or a more elegant centralized (model control) mode at loop time of 56  s.  In addition, it will levitate and control (with only minor modification to the input-output wiring) a two-axis and / or a four-axis system.  Stable rotor levitation and control of any of the system mentioned above are accomplished through appropriate key presses to modify parameters, such as stiffness, damping, and bias.  A signal generation block provides 11 excitation signals.  An excitation signal is then superimposed on the radial bearing x- and y- control signals, thus producing a resultant force vector.  By modulating the signals on the bearing x0 and y- axes with a cosine and sine function, respectively, a radial excitation force vector is made to rotate 360 about the bearing geometric center.  The rotation of the force vector is achieved manually by using key press or automatically by engaging the \" one-per-revolution\" feature.  Rotor rigid body modes can be excited by using the excitation module.  Depending on the polarities of the excitation signal in each radial bearing, the bounce or tilt mode will be excited","tags":["NASA","GRC","U.S. Release Only","Propulsion"],"contact":{"email":"grc-sra-team@mail.nasa.gov"},"organization":"GRC","identifier":"LEW-17293-1","repositoryURL":"https://software.nasa.gov/software/LEW-17293-1","permissions":{"licenses":[{"URL":"https://software.nasa.gov/faq","name":"Pending Release"}],"usageType":"governmentWideReuse","exemptionText":null},"laborHours":0,"date":{"created":"","lastModified":"","metadataLastUpdated":"2015-9-9"},"id":"NASA/A%20Comprehensive%20C%2B%2B%20Controller%20For%20A%20Magnetically%20Supported%20Vertical%20Rotor%3A%20Version%201.0","agency":"NASA"},"NASA/Radial%20Turbine%20Off-Design%20(RTOD)%20Performance%20Code":{"_id":{"$oid":"5a3a9b78da833f1e40fb6113"},"name":"Radial Turbine Off-Design (RTOD) Performance Code","description":"The RTOD code predicts the performance of a single-stage radial-inflow turbine (with either radial or swept rotor blades) as a function of pressure ratio, speed, and stator setting.","tags":["NASA","GRC","U.S. Release Only","System Testing"],"contact":{"email":"grc-sra-team@mail.nasa.gov"},"organization":"GRC","identifier":"LEW-14060-1","repositoryURL":"https://software.nasa.gov/software/LEW-14060-1","permissions":{"licenses":[{"URL":"https://software.nasa.gov/faq","name":"Pending Release"}],"usageType":"governmentWideReuse","exemptionText":null},"laborHours":0,"date":{"created":"","lastModified":"","metadataLastUpdated":"2014-4-15"},"id":"NASA/Radial%20Turbine%20Off-Design%20(RTOD)%20Performance%20Code","agency":"NASA"},"NASA/MERIDLN":{"_id":{"$oid":"5a3a9b78da833f1e40fb6114"},"name":"MERIDLN","description":"MERIDLN is a Fortran program for calculating velocities/streamlines of axial-, radial-, or mixed-flow turbo-machinery or annular ducts on the hub-shroud mid-channel stream surface.","tags":["NASA","GRC","U.S. Release Only","System Testing"],"contact":{"email":"grc-sra-team@mail.nasa.gov"},"organization":"GRC","identifier":"LEW-16369-1","repositoryURL":"https://software.nasa.gov/software/LEW-16369-1","permissions":{"licenses":[{"URL":"https://software.nasa.gov/faq","name":"Pending Release"}],"usageType":"governmentWideReuse","exemptionText":null},"laborHours":0,"date":{"created":"","lastModified":"","metadataLastUpdated":"2014-4-15"},"id":"NASA/MERIDLN","agency":"NASA"},"NASA/PCSTAGE":{"_id":{"$oid":"5a3a9b78da833f1e40fb6115"},"name":"PCSTAGE","description":"PCSTAGE is simple computational simulation of multi-stage turbo-machinery blade-to-blade flows on a surface of revolution.","tags":["NASA","GRC","U.S. Release Only","System Testing"],"contact":{"email":"grc-sra-team@mail.nasa.gov"},"organization":"GRC","identifier":"LEW-16325-1","repositoryURL":"https://software.nasa.gov/software/LEW-16325-1","permissions":{"licenses":[{"URL":"https://software.nasa.gov/faq","name":"Pending Release"}],"usageType":"governmentWideReuse","exemptionText":null},"laborHours":0,"date":{"created":"","lastModified":"","metadataLastUpdated":"2014-4-15"},"id":"NASA/PCSTAGE","agency":"NASA"},"NASA/RVCQ3D.406":{"_id":{"$oid":"5a3a9b78da833f1e40fb6116"},"name":"RVCQ3D.406","description":"RVCQ3D is a two-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis code for turbo-machinery (e.g., compressors, turbines, and mixed-flow machines).

It is composed of several parts:\r\n\r\nThe Advanced System for Integration and Spacecraft Testing (ASIST) is the user-interface, providing user with the ability to view and analyze telemetry, send commands, and automate tests. The Front End Data System reads telemetry from spacecrafts, distributing requested data packets to subscribing clients; additionally, it controls the forward (command) link to the spacecraft, formatting command packets so that the spacecraft can read them and verifying that commands are transferred correctly. The Digital History Data Store (DHDS) archives the raw telemetry received from the spacecraft and distributes historical telemetry data to clients.\r\n\r\nThis system can be configured in a number of ways. For small labs, a single ASIST workstation may be used, while in I&T or mission operations, the configuration may include up to 31 ASIST workstations. All configurations provide the user with the same standard interface to their flight hardware.","tags":["NASA","GSFC","U.S. Government Purpose Release","Vehicle Management (Space/Air/Ground)"],"contact":{"email":"gsfc-softwarerequest@mail.nasa.gov"},"organization":"GSFC","identifier":"GSC-16783-1","repositoryURL":"https://software.nasa.gov/software/GSC-16783-1","permissions":{"licenses":[{"URL":"https://software.nasa.gov/faq","name":"Pending Release"}],"usageType":"governmentWideReuse","exemptionText":null},"laborHours":0,"date":{"created":"","lastModified":"","metadataLastUpdated":"2015-2-5"},"id":"NASA/Advanced%20Spacecraft%20Integration%20%26%20System%20Test%20Software%20(ASIST)%20Version%2020.0","agency":"NASA"},"NASA/GMSEC%20Remote%20Application%20Service%20Provider%20(GRASP)%202.0":{"_id":{"$oid":"5a3a9b78da833f1e40fb61aa"},"name":"GMSEC Remote Application Service Provider (GRASP) 2.0","description":"This entirely new software utility facilitates the secure transmission of GMSEC messages from a secure environment to a less secure environment and makes these messages available to web applications operating in the less secure environment via a generic, language independent mechanism.","tags":["NASA","GSFC","U.S. Government Purpose Release","Vehicle Management (Space/Air/Ground)"],"contact":{"email":"gsfc-softwarerequest@mail.nasa.gov"},"organization":"GSFC","identifier":"GSC-16822-1","repositoryURL":"https://software.nasa.gov/software/GSC-16822-1","permissions":{"licenses":[{"URL":"https://software.nasa.gov/faq","name":"Pending Release"}],"usageType":"governmentWideReuse","exemptionText":null},"laborHours":0,"date":{"created":"","lastModified":"","metadataLastUpdated":"2016-7-18"},"id":"NASA/GMSEC%20Remote%20Application%20Service%20Provider%20(GRASP)%202.0","agency":"NASA"},"NASA/GMSEC%20API%20Performance%20Testing%20Utility%20v3.0":{"_id":{"$oid":"5a3a9b78da833f1e40fb61ab"},"name":"GMSEC API Performance Testing Utility v3.0","description":"Statistical performance testing tool used to test and measure the GMSEC middleware systems by recreatihng test scenarios under various configurations.

In the modular GRASP architecture, all operating system and hardware interfaces are isolated within GRASP libraries. The application developer uses GRASP interface libraries and device drivers to interact with external hardware. Should a new hardware item require a driver, that development would be part of GRASP and would be added to the GRASP interface libraries and become available for future projects. GRASP application software is developed by using the GRASP template, which offers access to the services GRASP provides. The templated generic code handles process initialization, thread creation, inter-process messaging, process health monitoring, data logging, data distribution, etc., with hooks that provide for subsystem tailoring. Using GRASP allows application developers to concentrate on mission specifics, reducing development time, cost, and risk.","tags":["NASA","GSFC","U.S. Government Purpose Release","Design and Integration Tools"],"contact":{"email":"gsfc-softwarerequest@mail.nasa.gov"},"organization":"GSFC","identifier":"GSC-15695-1","repositoryURL":"https://software.nasa.gov/software/GSC-15695-1","permissions":{"licenses":[{"URL":"https://software.nasa.gov/faq","name":"Pending Release"}],"usageType":"governmentWideReuse","exemptionText":null},"laborHours":0,"date":{"created":"","lastModified":"","metadataLastUpdated":"2014-4-15"},"id":"NASA/Generic%20Reusable%20Aerospace%20Software%20Platform%20(GRASP)","agency":"NASA"},"NASA/Advanced%20Spacecraft%20Integration%20and%20System%20Test%20Software%20(ASIST)%2C%20Front-End%20Data%20Systems%2FDigital%20History%20Data%20Store%20Software%20(FEDS%2FDHDS)%2C%20Updated":{"_id":{"$oid":"5a3a9b78da833f1e40fb61cf"},"name":"Advanced Spacecraft Integration and System Test Software (ASIST), Front-End Data Systems/Digital History Data Store Software (FEDS/DHDS), Updated","description":"From component development to integration, testing, and mission operations, this NASA technology provides a single spacecraft ground system for processing spacecraft telemetry and command data throughout the lifecycle of a program.

For example, the route might be from a Mars Rover to a Mars Orbiter to a Ground Station on Earth to a Mission Control Center.  For each hop along the way, BP asks for assistance from the appropriate lower-level protocol.  For example, to move bundles from a Ground Station to a Mission Control Center, it might use the Transmission Control Protocol (tcp).  Generally, the lower-level protocol is responsible for providing reliable delivery across one hop, while BP manages the bigger picture (i.e. getting bundles across all the required hops).\r\n\r\nThe Bundle Protocol Software Library implements the Bundle Protocol, using a software architecture that is simple and fast enough to be attractive to Goddard mission designers.

After guest registration, administrative support personnel have used EGO to maintain guest-seating assignments, send email communications, maintain attendance to special receptions, and gather security information for foreign guests. EGO replaces a very paper-intensive process, saves a significant amount in postage costs, and reduces error-prone data entry. The tool has been built with flexibility and customization in mind. Its initial scope was broadened to also serve as the login for people invited to view an International Space Station Friends and Family Web site created by Wyle Life Sciences.

The fundamental part of this code is the stochastic simulation of radiation track structure of heavy ions, an important component of space radiations. The code can calculate many relevant quantities such as the radial dose, voxel dose, and may also be used to calculate the dose in spherical and cylindrical targets of various sizes. Recently, we have incorporated DNA structure and damage simulations at the molecular scale in RITRACKS. The direct effect of radiations is simulated by introducing a slight modification of the existing particle transport algorithms, using the Binary-Encounter-Bethe model of ionization cross sections for each molecular orbitals of DNA. The simulation of radiation chemistry is done by a step-by-step diffusion-reaction program based on the Greens functions of the diffusion equation. This approach is also used to simulate the indirect effect of ionizing radiation on DNA. The software can be installed independently on PC and tablets using the Windows operating system and does not require any coding from the user. It includes a Graphic User Interface (GUI) and a 3D OpenGL visualization interface. The calculations are executed simultaneously (in parallel) on multiple CPUs.

Since not all missions are long enough to payback the mass of the recycling hardware, or may not need all possible resources that could be recycled, determining the best suite of technologies to provide the right amount of resource recovery for each mission is very difficult.  Because so many technological combinations are possible, the development of an Advanced Life Support Sizing Analysis Tool (ALSSAT) was created as a means to investigate these combinations. This tool assists in the determination of the most mass effective and reliable combination of methods available for a steady-state operating condition. ALSSAT has been developed using the Microsoft Excel spreadsheet program and has been programmed to perform multiple-case mission scenarios through Visual Basic (VB) interface forms for data input and computational analysis of ALS subsystems. Based on the preliminary design considerations, the Advanced Life Support system mass, power, and volume are computed for various mission specifications. The results can be used as a guide to select the best system architecture.","tags":["NASA","JSC","U.S. Release Only","Design and Integration Tools"],"contact":{"email":"jsc-ttco-software-request@mail.nasa.gov"},"organization":"JSC","identifier":"MSC-25510-1","repositoryURL":"https://software.nasa.gov/software/MSC-25510-1","permissions":{"licenses":[{"URL":"https://software.nasa.gov/faq","name":"Pending Release"}],"usageType":"governmentWideReuse","exemptionText":null},"laborHours":0,"date":{"created":"","lastModified":"","metadataLastUpdated":"2016-8-4"},"id":"NASA/Advanced%20Life%20Support%20Sizing%20Analysis%20Tool%20(ALSSAT)%20version%2012.0","agency":"NASA"},"NASA/General-Use%20Nodal%20Network%20Solver%20(GUNNS)":{"_id":{"$oid":"5a3a9b78da833f1e40fb632f"},"name":"General-Use Nodal Network Solver (GUNNS)","description":"C++ General Use Nodal Network Solver toolkit that can be used to simulate and solve complex networks of fluids, thermal and electrical systems.","tags":["NASA","JSC","U.S. Release Only","Design and Integration Tools"],"contact":{"email":"jsc-ttco-software-request@mail.nasa.gov"},"organization":"JSC","identifier":"MSC-25468-1","repositoryURL":"https://software.nasa.gov/software/MSC-25468-1","permissions":{"licenses":[{"URL":"https://software.nasa.gov/faq","name":"Pending Release"}],"usageType":"governmentWideReuse","exemptionText":null},"laborHours":0,"date":{"created":"","lastModified":"","metadataLastUpdated":"2014-4-15"},"id":"NASA/General-Use%20Nodal%20Network%20Solver%20(GUNNS)","agency":"NASA"},"NASA/Generic%20Command%20and%20Telemetry%20%20Applications%20for%20the%20Core%20Flight%20Software%20Framework%20(CI-TO)":{"_id":{"$oid":"5a3a9b78da833f1e40fb6330"},"name":"Generic Command and Telemetry  Applications for the Core Flight Software Framework (CI-TO)","description":"This set of applications provides general purpose, configurable, and extensible spacecraft commanding and telemetry functionality supporting a wide variety of communications protocols and transports, and was designed, built, and intended for reuse.","tags":["NASA","JSC","U.S. Government Purpose Release","Aeronautics"],"contact":{"email":"jsc-ttco-software-request@mail.nasa.gov"},"organization":"JSC","identifier":"MSC-26175-1","repositoryURL":"https://software.nasa.gov/software/MSC-26175-1","permissions":{"licenses":[{"URL":"https://software.nasa.gov/faq","name":"Pending Release"}],"usageType":"governmentWideReuse","exemptionText":null},"laborHours":0,"date":{"created":"","lastModified":"","metadataLastUpdated":"2016-8-17"},"id":"NASA/Generic%20Command%20and%20Telemetry%20%20Applications%20for%20the%20Core%20Flight%20Software%20Framework%20(CI-TO)","agency":"NASA"},"NASA/BUMPER%20Micrometeoroid%20and%20Orbital%20Debris%20Risk%20Assessment%20Tool%2C%20Version%203.0":{"_id":{"$oid":"5a3a9b78da833f1e40fb6331"},"name":"BUMPER Micrometeoroid and Orbital Debris Risk Assessment Tool, Version 3.0","description":"BUMPER is the primary risk analysis program used by NASA to provide safe and reliable operation of spacecraft exposed to the impacts of micrometeoroid/orbital debris (MMOD).

The algorithm is based on repeated random sampling of the configuration space of the system using the classical Boltzmann probability distribution. In the process, internal variables of the system, such as system energy, internal pressure, system size (strain), and others, are reported periodically. Atomic configurations, in terms of coordinates of all atoms, are stored periodically for a post-processing analysis, such as phase identification, lattice parameter estimates, free energy integration, etc. The algorithm uses MPI (message passing interface) to work on multi-core CPU platforms allowing simulations of multimilion atom systems. \r\n\r\nThe code is designed to help exploring the phase diagram of multi-component alloy systems, predict solid-state phase transformations such as austenite-martensite transformations, precipitate formation, recrystallization, capillary effects at interfaces, surface absorption, etc., which can aid the design of novel metallic alloys.

The program builds an EVA timeline to complete science and exploration objectives while complying with current human spaceflight limits on the number of hours of EVA allowed per day and week.  At completion, the program displays the timeline, number of days to complete all requirements, number of rest days, and number of sites visited.  The database keeps a record of activities and building blocks used in all surface missions and is easily searchable by the user or the program.","tags":["NASA","LaRC","U.S. Release Only","Operations"],"contact":{"email":"larc-sra@mail.nasa.gov"},"organization":"LaRC","identifier":"LAR-18726-1","repositoryURL":"https://software.nasa.gov/software/LAR-18726-1","permissions":{"licenses":[{"URL":"https://software.nasa.gov/faq","name":"Pending Release"}],"usageType":"governmentWideReuse","exemptionText":null},"laborHours":0,"date":{"created":"","lastModified":"","metadataLastUpdated":"2016-9-23"},"id":"NASA/Timeline%20Builder%20Assistant%20(TBA)","agency":"NASA"},"NASA/Low%20Fidelity%20Space%20Systems%20Analysis%20Tools-Short%20Duration%20Habitat%20Sizing%20Tool":{"_id":{"$oid":"5a3a9b78da833f1e40fb6389"},"name":"Low Fidelity Space Systems Analysis Tools-Short Duration Habitat Sizing Tool","description":"This tool sizes short duration human habitats for short missions less than 20 days based on identified human operations requirements.","tags":["NASA","LaRC","U.S. Release Only","Design and Integration Tools"],"contact":{"email":"larc-sra@mail.nasa.gov"},"organization":"LaRC","identifier":"LAR-18738-1","repositoryURL":"https://software.nasa.gov/software/LAR-18738-1","permissions":{"licenses":[{"URL":"https://software.nasa.gov/faq","name":"Pending Release"}],"usageType":"governmentWideReuse","exemptionText":null},"laborHours":0,"date":{"created":"","lastModified":"","metadataLastUpdated":"2016-9-23"},"id":"NASA/Low%20Fidelity%20Space%20Systems%20Analysis%20Tools-Short%20Duration%20Habitat%20Sizing%20Tool","agency":"NASA"},"NASA/Low%20Fidelity%20Space%20Systems%20Analysis%20Tools-Thermal%20Protection%20System%20Sizing%20Tool":{"_id":{"$oid":"5a3a9b78da833f1e40fb638a"},"name":"Low Fidelity Space Systems Analysis Tools-Thermal Protection System Sizing Tool","description":"This system sizes Thermal Protection Systems based on simple flight path angle assessments and mass properties of the vehicle.

Among other things, the ART affords a capability to synthesize coarser-spatial-resolution image-data sets from finer-spatial-resolution data sets and multispectral-image-data products from hyperspectral-image-data products. The ART also provides for synthesis of image-degradation effects, including point-spread functions, misregistration of spectral images, and noise. The ART can utilize real or synthetic data sets, along with sensor specifications, to create simulated data sets. In one example of a typical application, simulated data pertaining to an existing multispectral sensor system are used to verify the data collected by the system in operation. In the case of a proposed sensor system, the simulated data can be used to conduct trade studies and statistical analyses to ensure that the sensor system will satisfy the requirements of potential scientific, academic, and commercial user communities.

Most current methods for assessing spatial resolution characteristics of imagery rely on pre-deployed engineered targets and are performed only at selected times within pre-selected scenes. The SRVT addresses these insufficiencies by finding uniform, high-contrast edges from urban scenes and then using these edges to determine standard estimators of spatial resolution, such as the modulation transfer function (MTF) and the relative edge response (RER).\r\n\r\nDeveloped using the MATLAB programming language and environment, this automated software algorithm assesses every image in an acquired data set, using edges found within each image, and in many cases eliminating the need for dedicated edge targets. SRVT automatically identifies  high-contrast, uniform edges and calculates the MTF and RER of each image, and when possible, within sections of an image, so that the variation of spatial resolution characteristics across the image can be analyzed. The automated algorithm is capable of quickly verifying the spatial resolution quality of all images within a data set, enabling the appropriate use of those images in a number of applications.\r\nThe SRVT has been validated against traditional techniques using IKONOS and QuickBird satellite imagery.","tags":["NASA","SSC","U.S. Government Purpose Release","Data and Image Processing"],"contact":{"email":"ssc-technology@nasa.gov"},"organization":"SSC","identifier":"SSC-00339","repositoryURL":"https://software.nasa.gov/software/SSC-00339","permissions":{"licenses":[{"URL":"https://software.nasa.gov/faq","name":"Pending Release"}],"usageType":"governmentWideReuse","exemptionText":null},"laborHours":0,"date":{"created":"","lastModified":"","metadataLastUpdated":"2014-4-15"},"id":"NASA/Spatial%20Resolution%20Verification%20Tool%20(SRVT)","agency":"NASA"},"NASA/39A":{"_id":{"$oid":"5a3a9b78da833f1e40fb63ff"},"name":"39A","description":"39A is the software used to power the 2013 International Space Apps Challenge, a global hackathon focusing on space technology and issues.","tags":["NASA","Hackathon"],"contact":{"email":"jason.duley@nasa.gov"},"organization":"CIO","identifier":"NASA-39A","repositoryURL":"https://github.com/nasa/39A","permissions":{"licenses":[{"URL":"https://github.com/nasa/39A/blob/master/LICENSE","name":"NASA v3"}],"usageType":"openSource","exemptionText":null},"laborHours":0,"date":{"created":"","lastModified":"","metadataLastUpdated":"2017-08-23"},"id":"NASA/39A","agency":"NASA"},"NASA/Advanced%20Diagnostics%20and%20Prognostics%20Testbed%20(ADAPT)":{"_id":{"$oid":"5a3a9b78da833f1e40fb6400"},"name":"Advanced Diagnostics and Prognostics Testbed (ADAPT)","description":"The IVHM Project in the Aviation Safety Program has funded research in electrical power system (EPS) health management. This problem domain contains both discrete and continuous behavior, and thus is directly relevant for the hybrid diagnostic tool HyDE. In FY2007 work was performed to expand the HyDE diagnosis model of the ADAPT system. The work completed resulted in a HyDE model with the capability to diagnose five times the number of ADAPT components than was previously tested. The expanded diagnosis model passed a corresponding set of new ADAPT fault injection scenario tests with no incorrect faults reported. The time required for the HyDE diagnostic system to isolate the fault varied widely between tests; this variance was reduced by tuning of the HyDE input parameters. These results and other diagnostic design tradeoffs are discussed. Finally, possible future improvements for both the HyDE diagnostic model and HyDE itself are presented.","tags":["NASA","electrical power system","IVHM","testbed","ADAPT","diagnostics","prognostics"],"contact":{"email":"jason.duley@nasa.gov"},"organization":"ARC","identifier":"NASA-Advanced_Diagnostics_Prognostics_Testbed_(ADAPT)","repositoryURL":"https://dashlink.arc.nasa.gov/static/dashlink/media/dataset/Exp_BN.tar.gz","permissions":{"licenses":[{"URL":"https://opensource.org/licenses/NASA-1.3","name":"NASA v3"}],"usageType":"openSource","exemptionText":null},"laborHours":0,"date":{"created":"","lastModified":"","metadataLastUpdated":"2017-08-23"},"id":"NASA/Advanced%20Diagnostics%20and%20Prognostics%20Testbed%20(ADAPT)","agency":"NASA"},"NASA/Adverse%20Condition%20%26%20Critical%20Event%20Prediction%20Toolbox%20(ACCEPT)":{"_id":{"$oid":"5a3a9b78da833f1e40fb6401"},"name":"Adverse Condition & Critical Event Prediction Toolbox (ACCEPT)","description":"ACCEPT is an open source machine learning code for model development to support both regression and detection modules, including fidelity analysis.","tags":["NASA","machine learning","model development","regression","detection"],"contact":{"email":"rodney.martin@nasa.gov"},"organization":"ARC","identifier":"NASA-ACCEPT","repositoryURL":"https://c3.nasa.gov/dashlink/static/media/algorithm/ACCEPT_osrelease_1.6.tar.gz","permissions":{"licenses":[{"URL":"https://opensource.org/licenses/NASA-1.3","name":"NASA v3"}],"usageType":"openSource","exemptionText":null},"laborHours":0,"date":{"created":"","lastModified":"","metadataLastUpdated":"2017-08-23"},"id":"NASA/Adverse%20Condition%20%26%20Critical%20Event%20Prediction%20Toolbox%20(ACCEPT)","agency":"NASA"},"NASA/Apache%20OODT":{"_id":{"$oid":"5a3a9b78da833f1e40fb6402"},"name":"Apache OODT","description":"Apache OODT is NASA's first project to be stewarded at the open source Apache Software Foundation.

The software uses an iterative, non-linear retrieval technique (optimal estimation). After the retrieval process has converged, the software performs an error analysis. The products of the software include all quantities needed to understand the information content of the measurement, its uncertainty, and its dependence on interfering atmospheric properties. Spectra from ground-based or space-based measurement with arbitrary observation geometry can be analyzed. The retrieved parameters can be chosen from a large set of atmospheric (e.g., volume mixing ratio of gases or aerosol optical depth), surface (e.g., Lambertian reflection), and instrument (e.g., spectral shift or instrument line shape parameters) parameters. The software uses an accurate, state-of-the-art, multiple-scattering radiative transfer code combined with an efficient polarization approximation to simulate measured spectra. The software enables fast and highly accurate simulations of broad spectral ranges by an optional parallelization of the frequency processing in the radiative transfer model. The framework was written with flexibility in mind. New algorithms and instruments are added by creating additional classes that implement the defined interfaces.

software retrieves a set of atmospheric/surface/instrument parameters from a simultaneous fit to spectra from multiple absorption bands. The software uses an iterative, non-linear retrieval technique (optimal estimation). After the retrieval process has converged, the software performs an error analysis. The products of the software include all quantities needed to understand the information content of the measurement, its uncertainty, and its dependence on interfering atmospheric properties. Spectra from ground-based or space-based measurement with arbitrary observation geometry can be analyzed. The retrieved parameters can be chosen from a large set of atmospheric (e.g., volume mixing ratio of gases or aerosol optical depth), surface (e.g., Lambertian reflection), and instrument (e.g., spectral shift or instrument line shape parameters) parameters. The software uses an accurate, state-of-the-art, multiple-scattering radiative transfer code combined with an efficient polarization approximation to simulate measured spectra. The software enables fast and highly accurate simulations of broad spectral ranges by an optional parallelization of the frequency processing in the radiative transfer model. The framework was written with flexibility in mind. New algorithms and instruments are added by creating additional classes that implement the defined interfaces. Bindings are available for both Python and Lua.","tags":["NASA","Framework","Radiative Transfer","Forward Model","Atmosphere","Retrieval","Earth Science","C++","Python","Lua"],"contact":{"email":"james.mcduffie@jpl.nasa.gov"},"organization":"JPL","repositoryURL":"https://github.com/nasa/RtRetrievalFrameworkDoc","permissions":{"licenses":[{"URL":"https://github.com/nasa/RtRetrievalFramework/blob/master/LICENSE.txt","name":"NASA v3"}],"usageType":"openSource","exemptionText":null},"laborHours":0,"date":{"created":"","lastModified":"","metadataLastUpdated":"2017-08-23"},"id":"NASA/RtRetrievalFrameworkDoc","agency":"NASA"},"NASA/General%20Mission%20Analysis%20Tool%20(GMAT)%20v.R2017a":{"_id":{"$oid":"5a3a9b78da833f1e40fb6460"},"name":"General Mission Analysis Tool (GMAT) v.R2017a","description":"The General Mission Analysis Tool (GMAT) is the worlds only enterprise, multi-mission, open source software system for space mission design, optimization, and navigation.
