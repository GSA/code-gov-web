<h1>Agency Compliance</h1>
<p>
  The Source Code Policy requires agencies to perform specific one-time and recurring tasks in order to be considered compliant. Currently, agencies are being evaluated on whether they've completed two tasks:
</p>
<ol>
  <li><b>Revised agency policy</b>: agencies must update their policies to be consistent with the Source Code Policy.</li>
  <li><b>Complete code inventory</b>: agencies must publish a complete inventory of their source code in the prescribed format on their website.</li>
  <li><b>Open source target</b>: agencies must open source 20% or more of their new custom code post August 2016.</li>
</ol>

<p>Agencies are rated as fully, partially, or non-compliant with these factors - green, yellow or red. An agency's overall compliance is green only if both of the factors are green.
