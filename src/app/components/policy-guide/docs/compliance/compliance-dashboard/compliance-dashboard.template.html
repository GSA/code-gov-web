<h1>Agency Compliance</h1>
<p>
  Agencies are required to perform various tasks in order to satisfy the objectives of the Federal Source Code Policy. Currently, agencies are evaluated on whether they've completed three tasks:
</p>
<ol>
  <li><b>Updated agency policy</b>: Agencies must update their policies to be consistent with the Federal Source Code Policy.</li>
  <li><b>Completed code inventory</b>: Agencies must inventory all new custom code created after August 2016 (notwithstanding exceptions enumerated in the Federal Source Code Policy).</li>
  <li><b>Completed open source objective</b>: Agencies must open source at least 20% of all new custom code created after August 2016.</li>
</ol>

<p>Agencies are evaluated as fully compliant (green), partially compliant (yellow), or non-compliant (red) with the tasks outlined above. An agency's overall compliance is green only if they are green in all categories.
